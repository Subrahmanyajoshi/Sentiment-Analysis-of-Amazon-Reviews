"Great CD: My lovely Pat has one of the GREAT voices of her generation. I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing ""Who was that singing ?""

"One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.

"Batteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.

"Great for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD's. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.

"DVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.

"Unique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. ""Dr Shen Fu"", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price.

"Not an ""ultimate guide"": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.

"A complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my ""operating system limitations"". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.

"TRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.

I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that?

"Simple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.

"Don't Take the Chance - Get the SE Branded Cable: If you purchase this data cable, you need to know that you will receive no real directions or information regarding what to check if nothing works. As directed, I downloaded all of the files from the SE site (70MB on dial up!), and then downloaded all of the user guides. Everything seemed to install ok, but nothing would make my phone be recognized. After that I scoured the SE site for troubleshooting info on their branded cable-in the hope that something would help me figure out the problem. After 2 full days of beating my head against the wall, I finally threw the cable and the useless CD that came with it in the trash.If I had used my brain I would have paid the extra $$ for a SE branded cable and software (and the support that comes along with that). I now have the real deal (SE data cable and software), and guess what? Yep, installation was a breeze and it works beautifully. You really do get what you pay for.

"Book of Chance: I had just finished reading 'The Food of Love' by Anthony Capella since I had nothing to do, but read. Mind you, reading is one of my favorite pastimes.I had recently bought a series of books. The Food of Love was just one of the books I just picked up so I can get that 'three for the price of two' deal at Waterstones in London (British's equivalent of Barnes&Noble;). I wasn't really interested, but it was one of the more interesting options I had. Well, I'm glad I made the right choice! I started reading it last night and I haven't put it down since.If you love food and a little romance, which I am both fond of, it's an excellent book to read. Mr. Capella was remarkably thorough in his description of the rich and textured Italian dishes that the words assails you with a sense of smell and taste that leaves you hungry for more. This book took me by surprise and I'm sure you would not be disappointed.

"Light reading, light in substance: A clichéd storyline based on the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, this book reads like a rookie novel written by someone who has a knowledge and passion for Italian culture and cuisine, but little experience in developing a story. I can understand Bruno and his passion for cooking, but have no clue as to his passion for Laura. It seems to be primarily based on her being a blonde American. How exotic. Her character is so underdeveloped- we know she's studying art history, and she enjoys Bruno's cooking with a passion. That's about it. And Tomasso, he's just the cliché for any over-sexed Mediterranean male who encounters foreign females.It's a light and entertaining read if you can get beyond all of the reasons you should put it down and walk away. That being said, I will, however, check out this author's more recent novels. He does seem to have a way with technical details, hopefully his storytelling has caught up.

"Real HTML for people who build sites for a living: This book is simply great! If you build sites for a living you probably struggle with books that trivialize HTML and present its syntax willy-nilly. This book is the ONLY book I've ever seen that actually seems to be written by someone who builds sites professionally and wants to know all the markup. It explains logical and physical tagging styles well and does a really good job showing how to hook HTML with other technologies without trying to teach CGI, CSS, etc. at the same time. The only thing I wish is that this guy would write a JavaScript or DHTML book. I'd buy that right away.

"More Romance Please and Less Mystery!!: the reason i gave two stars when I usually give 5 stars for ms. feehan's books is b/c this book was tooooooo mystery/gothic genre rather than romance. I really didn't feel like the two main characters were in love, in fact the entire book was almost entirely from the heroine's point of view and I was getting sick of her whining and her point of view. unlike the ""dark"" series, you really didnt feel any passion. the book is better suited for the mystery/gothic genre and NOT romance.even the mystery was not that good! its only in the last chapter that for some unforseen reason the villain confesses all in less than three pages. throughout the entire book, you're kept in suspense of who was the bad guy, if you wanted to know who it was look at the last couple of pages....Ms. Feehan, if your reading, please focuse more on the main characters relation to each other rather then distract us with so much unamusing mystery!

"A Lost Author: I have read all of the Carpathian novels to date, except one. I very much enjoyed them at first, but nothing EVER gets resolved. You would think that after 16 books something would have been resolved and a new obstacle introduced. As for this book, it is an off-shoot of another Carpathian novel about the Jaguar Line. I was hoping to find out more about this curse, the origins and why the males kill the females. Nothing, not a word about the Jaguar curse. And why do the walls and ceilings change? Ideas introduced and left at that. Ms. Feehan went, once again, off on a tagent. Her books become less and less meaty and more and more expensive.

Her books just get better and better as you go through the Kay Scarpetta series.I really enjoy the series concept and the fact that some of the same characters keep returning from book to book. It's nice to see the characters develop through each story line. It allows you to get comfortable with them, get close to them, and get frustrated with them when they do something out of character.I highly recommend reading not just this book but the entire Kay Scarpetta series.

"Best of the First Four in this series.: This is an awesome book. Kay just keeps getting better and better. It's also fun to see the characters develop more with each book - Kay herself as she seems to be always ""one against the world"", Marino who it appears is heading towards some sort of heart attack, Lucy who seems to be getting more and more quixotic. In this book Kay finds herself smack in the middle of a series of gruesome killings. It appears that a recently executed murderer, who Kay herself has seen on her autopsy table, is still around committing crimes. A number of murders occur where the executed murderer's fingerprints are turning up. Kay, Marino and Benton try to track a killer, but it appears that the corruption goes up a long ways into the political stratosphere. This is a taut and totally believable thriller. I can't wait until the next one because the book ended with the way wide open to the next installment.

It is a constant barrage of pathetic behavior. I just don't believe that there are this many people out here that are like this and can relate to this behavior. Very Disappointing.

"Wonderful, baffling mix: This has just about everything. The rabbi, of course, is learned and devout, even if his schooling causes some nervousness. The cat becomes fantastical when some mystery grants him human speech. The visit abroad captures all the distrust of the alien that the most insular of small-towners can summon. And, around all of that, the monotonous drama of life unfolds: loves, losses, and changes that no one knows how to ride out.Comics have moved well past the BamPow genre into many other idioms - this might border on chick lit, but much less than some. If reality and fantasy remain negotiable for you, with deep family devotions and deeper (or shallower) personal ones, the ragged lines of this comic might touch you.-- wiredweird

When I read that this book was being made into a movie, it seemed a good opportunity to read her, before seeing the screen mess up her work.

It is unrealistic, fails to capture the reader, and at points when I should have been completely engrossed, left me struggling with whether I wanted to pick it up. I hope she has written better than this, or else, there are a lot of people who have not bothered reading some of the strong authors available.Her characters are not sympathetic, they do not draw the reader's attention, and they are dull in overall scope.

Scarpetta is still overly materialistic & self-righteous which has gotten old.One of many gripes would be that I find it very hard to believe that all the crime agencies & the media have zero knowledge of this serial killer's family background (close family members - like a twin sister).My advice - don't let this be your 1st Scarpetta novel.

But plenty of economic data was available which the author managed to circumvent. Probably the book's greatest failing was to compare the field of economics to other sciences. Even with today's analytical resources, economists are still all over the map on their predictions & conclusions. On the other hand, meteorologists seem to do quite well.Naturally the radical libertarians, tea-baggers & Republicans love this slim volume which is even slimmer on evidence.

I tried it on and wore for about 2 hours, and then the 2nd time I wore it had it on for about the same period of time. I took it off and one of the metal boning pieces had popped through and was hanging out at the bottom. This product is far too expensive to have something like that happen. The fit on me was snug, but I am sure I had the correct size. Now I have to figure out how to get this resolved.

"The amazing squeem: I love love love the squeem!!! The before and after pictures are definitely real!!! You can immediately tell the difference when you put it on it definitely improves your posture, you eat much less since it squeezes the he'll outta you but its not an uncomfortable squeeze.

"Great Product: A friend recommended this product to flatten the tummy for great look in a dress. I brought a medium according to the measurement guide lines but I needed a small. It was extremely difficult to put on so I needed assistance. Once it was on I was still able to contract my core, which meant that I needed a smaller size. I believe it is because my waist sits high on my torso. Other then that this is great buy.

"I recommend ordering a size or 2 larger than your regular size.: I ordered the Squeem waist shaper in a size small...my general size is 4-6, I'm 5'4 and weigh 120lbs right now; over the winter I ate too much cheese and gained about 7 lbs which isn't much to complain about but I have a roll of belly fat that shows through a slinky dress (I just wanted to smooth out my middle and fat above my hips). I wish I'd ordered a medium (or even large) instead because as I was hooking the waist shaper from top to bottom as instructed it was way way way too tight by the time I tried to hook the lower 6"" above my hips. I don't want to be uncomfortable I just want a smooth finish! So, if you're similar in size I recommend ordering a medium instead. In general the quality of the product is exceptionally well stitched and built to last.

"WASTE OF MONEY: The inner metal rods keep poking through: The squeem is a great idea but the construction is not the best. While the product compresses your stomach, the inner metal spines bend and then protrude at the ends. I have had to sew the ends repeatedly but the spines keep poking through. At one point, the spine developed some sort of crack and when it poked through the bottom, it scraped my stomach and I took it off immediately. I have never washed the product in the washing machine...I have always handwashed it. So, the manufacturer can't say that I didn't take good care of it.

"CAUSES BRUISING AND BLISTERS IF WORN TOO LONG: I ordered this product to slim down my stomach. I was looking for something I could wear all day with my jeans as well as underneath my dresses. I wore the squeem to work occasionally and then I would take it off when I got home. When I would take it off, I felt sore around my sides and my back, I washed the squeem several times and even wore it on the other side thinking this would help but it didn't. One night after work me and some of my coworkers went out for drinks so I ended up keeping the squeem on for about 14hours instead of my normal 9 hours. That night when I took the squeem off I had blisters and bruising on my side and back which have now left black marks (I'm black)on my body. I read other review before I purchased the squeem and I didn't see anything that alerted me not to buy it. Not sure why this happened but if you read this and it happens to you don't say I didn't warn you!

"Not happy: I was really unhappy with this. I followed what others said and ordered based on my prepregnancy size. It was WAY too small at 7 weeks post-pardum.

"Does the job: I have been looking for something to hold in my stomach that wasn't elastic based. Found this item and have to say I am pretty pleased. The hooks do take a while, but once they are all done, the waist cincher does what it says it will do. The only negative thing is what a lot of the other reviews complain about. It does tend to cause back fat to appear more prominent by your underarms. So I can't wear this with a top that is clingy. Can only wear with looser fitting shirts. Oh well, nothing is perfect.

"conspiracy theorist: The author is very likely a Kurdish nationalist, not implausibly a quite supporter of the PKK. As a Communist, he has no room for religion. His analysis is misleading, basically he runs after Muslims under the banner of Islamism, he seeks to undermine the Islamic religion to satisfy his own psychological needs. The author has suppervised the work of others who also claimed to have proved that Islam does not work. The author does not use objective scientific methods, he basically writes in a way that confirms his own priori conclusions. Read the book, if you wish, but with such qualifications in mind. You may read it to understand how the bigot's mind actually works.

"Another disappointment from Higgins: This novella (stretched to 271 pages by wide margins and double-spaced lines) reads like a screenplay treatment. There is very little character development, movie-like dialogue, and plenty of mindless action. The ending is wholly unsatisfying and I'm led to believe that this is simply a set-up for another book. An author with some integrity would have placed Edge of Danger as part 1 of a 2-part novel.If you are dead-set on reading Edge of Danger, don't waste your money. The cover price of .....is an insult and the deeply discounted .......... price will still leave you feeling ripped-off. Go to your local library in the morning and you'll finish Edge of Danger in time for an early lunch. Just don't expect to have any appetite left.

As I travelled thro' the pages it just got harder and harder to believe the simplicity with which Mr Dillon strolls thro' the events at hand. The story also lacks any imagination and could probably have been summed up in a short story. Mr Dillon is just to sci-fi I'm afraid.There is a quote at the start of the book and as I got near the final chapters, I was starting to imagine that the Author would be writing the finale of Mr Dillon....the quote read""To Tess, who thinks it's about time""Author, I think she may mean something else....

"This edition is not complete: This review refers to ISBN 978-1613823613. With no explanation or indication that it is doing so, this edition leaves out the author's introductory chapter, ""The Custom-House."" Admittedly, the chapter is long, tedious, and skipped by many. Still, it leaves the book useless for the classroom and, let's face it, who else is going to read it? This isn't exactly light summer reading.In addition, there is no bolding of SAT words, with definitions in the margins, that some reviewers mention, which was the main reason I chose this edition. In fact, other than the abbreviated text, there is absolutely nothing: no forward, no reader's guide, no author bio -- nothing. So, not the most helpful textbook.On the bright side, it is well-bound and the type is quite easy to read.I am returning the book, and looking for a more suitable edition.

"Great novel: The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a great novel. It takes place in Boston, Massachusetts during the era when Puritans were there. The main character Hester Prynne is forced to wear a Scarlet Letter A for adultery because she cheats on her husband while waiting for him to come from Europe.The book really recaptures what Puritanism was like. Its interesting to think about what America would be like if we were still Puritan. A theme of the book is concealed guilt. The minister Arthur Dimmesdale has concealed guilt which causes him severe pain. The message of the book is that you shouldn't let some minor sin you did in the past haunt you for the rest of your life.The book denounces the religious atmosphere of the Puritan village claiming that it stifled the merriment and joy of the culture of Old England. You get a picture of how the wonderful culture portrayed in the works of Chaucer was lost in America due to the influence of the Puritans.

I PAID for the Penguin edition. I GOT the $2 Dover Thrift edition three weeks later. When I called the distributor, he told me to email him to remind him to fix it, but he didn't ask me my name or my order number or anything to identify me from any other customer. I asked for an email address and he told me to look on my confirmation email. The email address from the confirmation email didn't work. I had to spend another $15 to get the correct edition of the book. I'd already paid more for the book that I got than it would have been worth brand new. I will NOT purchase from this distributor again.

"The ""Scarlet"" Letter: Much to my amazement, this book has been placed on banned lists in several states. It's an excellent study of the devastation caused by guilt. Although the story does allude frequently to adultery, there are no graphic details that would make it unsuitable for use in a high school classroom. Both the illnesses caused by guilt and the good health of those who overcome it are made clear.

"The Scarlet Letter a must read for any American: The best book that I have ever been assigned to read for school by far. The way in which Hawthorne captures the shame that Hetser , the wearer of the scarlet letter, feels everyday and the utter torment that the weak Dimmesdale is in by not coming forth and saying he slept with Hester and the revenge ridden character of Chillingworth is spectactular.The way in which Hawthorne describes the setting and the actions that characters do is truly outstanding. Hawthorne has a huge flare for the dramatic which is great for the reader. Since Hester the main character concieved her daughter Pearl through an affair she has been snetenced to wear the scarlet A on her chest for the rest of her life. The story starts on the day Hester is to stand infront of the town and wear her badge of shame and all the drama in the small puritanical town of Boston starts from there. A must read for any American.

"The Scarlet Letter: A soap opera: Although this book, is considered a great work of literature, written to describe the harshness of Purtian New England. Plus, this book was heavily laiden with symbolism, and many other literary tools.The scarlet letter is a soap opera, and a bad one at that. Not only is it boring, no true action occurs in this book. Nothing truly interesting happens in this book. This boring work of literature spends an entire chapter describing a prison door.Although the author did a creative job of conveying his point, this is still the worst book I have ever read. I would never recomend this book to anyone who can not sit down and read the script to any second class soap opera with out falling asleep after the first 10 pages.

"It Rises above the ""Fluff"" Books: The first thing that struck me was that it was easy to read. The print was readable and the illustrations were helpful. I did also find some grammatical errors as an earlier review said. But mostly it was very specific and practical. The chapters most helpful were on ""emotional states"" and music. It's hard to find a book on this subject that's across the board, dealing with many different issues and this one addresses nearly every brain-related research issue from nutrition to memory. As a scientist who also works with high school students, I found his translation of brain research into the classroom to be thoughtful, if not enthusiastic. It's a tough subject to translate, but I did get more than I thought I would out of the book. Mostly it helped me get past the hype and get into the real practical meat of the material. The book's far from perfect, but it's the best I've seen so far on this topic.

"Proof that good things are built to last: When Mr. Schulz and Bill Melendez decided to launch this half-hour special for TV there were many things against the odds: The music, subject treatment and Linus's Bible reading were unlike anything else tried on TV before. Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - ""Sparky"" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions.

The Mac screen would dim and brighten dim and brighten. Boy, was I glad to notice that the on screen battery light was cycling between a/c and battery. Unplugged the Macally, computer ran fine on just battery. Runs fine on the Apple charger I had left at home.The good news is the return to Amazon was extremely easy, presuming the lack of destroyed packaging doesn't void my refund.I've ordered a different brand (with light!). This one may have just been a bad example. I've had good luck with other Macally gear.

"Plain and Simple: A Journey to the Amish: This is a very disapointing book. The author makes the complexe Amish community that forgave the muders of their young daughters at Nickle Mine school into one diminsional Disney characters. There is no tension, conflict or any of the human conditions that make people real, just a oh so sweet group of simple people.Of course that does not allow us to learn anything from the Amish and I am sure there is a lot to be learn from them.The author is very self absorbed when she tries to draw any lessons from her time with the Amish. There were spots where I though ""O please get over yourself"". I didn't finish the book, it was a waste of time.

"Disturbing.: If you are looking for a book on Amish theology, history, lifestyle or agricultural technique; look elsewhere. A five minute Yahoo search will yield you a veritable library of resources compared to this book. Surprisingly, there is ample information online about this oft misunderstood sect of Christendom.The book did have a modicum of useful information, but not enough to warrant the mandatory single star.I found the author's whining fits, pontifications and raging narcissism beyond nauseating. It was with great pleasure that I found myself at the last page.Ultimately, this book serves not as a commentary on the Amish, but rather that of the disaffected Yuppie lifestyle the author is from. What the author found so utterly alien about the Amish wasn't their anachronistic culture, but rather that their of love of God and family exceeds everything else.

"Solid Effort...But Missing a Spark: Statheads and fantasy players know that the value of this book is to be found in its statistics and projections for future performances. Anyone playing in a long-term keeper league will benefit by keeping this near them on draft day as they look for prospects to take flyers on. The stats in this book are as good as ever, as is the top-100 prospect list.This edition falls flat in its essays. In the past the essays read like great magazine articles that mixed stats and narrative in a 1:9 ratio. This year's essays are far more statitically driven, and are written in a 3:6 ratio, meaning that the flow of the articles is interuppted frequently by data analysis.This makes the book far dryer than usual, and more of a chore to get through. It's still invaluable as a reference tool, but as entertainment it falls a little short.

"A Man of Reason: At the height of The Age of Reason, The United States of America was created by men such as Thomas Paine and many others who held Man above all other philosophies long enough to get the idea ""Individual Rights"" down on paper in the form of The Constitution of the United States of America. Paine's contribution to this end is well known. Paine noted in this book that ""we have it in our power to make the world over again"", and they did. Man has a right to his own life, and there is no law above this. No one has a right to another man's life, not God, not the Race, not the dictatorship, not the proletariat, not The Great Society nor the New Deal. Thanks to Thomas Paine and men like him we have it in writing ""We own our own life and we are free to dispose of it in our own way"". Let's work together as free men and women to keep our freedom and to spread it around the world to our oppressed brothers and sisters. To the Glory of Man!!

"Absolutely incredible: I was so happy with Dolly's ""Hungry Again,"" and her return to real country. I like new country -- but now it is just like pop music. Quite a few one-hit wonders. But Dolly Parton, like Tori Amos and Ani DiFranco (two that came to mind), makes an entire album of great music, instead of an album that showcases two hit songs. If you like folk/indie music, I think you will love this bluegrass album. Her cover of Johnny Cash's ""I Still Miss Someone"" gave me chills. My favorite song is definitely ""Will He Be Waiting For Me."" This is bluegrass, but I definitely like a female singing it. It just mellows it out. Dolly has now put out two great albums and with rumors of her possibly going on tour, I couldn't be happier. I'm 26, have been listening to her since I was little, and have never gotten to see her perform live. But this album, the critics aren't just praising a country hall of famer -- the album deserves every wonderful word.

"Has-Been? THINK AGAIN!: As a child, I grew up in Knoxville, TN watching Dolly Partin on the Cas Walker Farm & Home Show. I remember her singing Bluegrass back then and didn't really appreciate what I was hearing. Unfortunately, she got away from her roots. Now she has returned with a brilliantly crafted CD that has critics and her fans screaming her praises. Dolly's voice is perfectly suited to singing Bluegrass and shines through like a beacon in the dark. The arrangements are simple and understated and the song selection impeccable. (As a Tenneseean, I wish she would have included her awesome version of Rocky Top or at least updated it.) Dolly's gonna give a lot of fellow artists a run for their money this year at the Grammy's with The Grass is Blue and Trio II. A Top 10 CD if I ever heard one!

"One of my favorites as a kid: I loved this book when I was about eight years old, and looking back on it, it's easy to see why: William, the main character, is a gymnast (just as I was) who's rather shy and reserved (just as I was) but manages, when it's important, to help the people around him. He's immensely sympathetic and compelling, and though the familiar fantasyland and evil-wizard-ruling-a-faux-medieval-kingdom plotline hold few surprises for adult readers familiar with the conventions of the genre, it surprised and excited me as a kid.Re-reading it recently, I found it didn't hold up as well as some of my favorite books from when I was younger (such as Madeleine L'Engle's A Ring of Endless Light), but it holds up better than many; this is a strong book for both children and for adults. I have a hard time imagining a more perfect book for bed-time reading.

"Lara should have remained in the tomb: I was so looking forward to this game being released, I was on the internet on a weekly basis looking for a new release date. Delay after delay. I bought the game the day of it's release. Loaded it onto my computer, and was ready to play. I had one disappointment after another. First, the controls were different from her other games. OK I will get use to the new ones. Second, and the biggest. Controlling her is virtually impossible. She is jerky, sporadic, and down right slow and awkward. I have had to reload the game about 20 times to get her to do a simple maneuver. I have given up many times in shear frustration. Frustration I haven't felt in her other games. I do not think I will continue playing this game. It is time to move on and enjoy myself with another game, which is what games are all about.

"Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book: This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!

"Well, not everything: It was a decent book, but not a lot of new information for me. For the most part, it simply confirmed some basics I have long believed in - not living out your dreams through your children, encouraging exploration without forcing achievement, the need to provide for additional means of learning, etc. A lot of time spent on selecting schools for gifted kids, which really doesn't apply in small towns like we live in. Some good chapters on different kinds of gifted children and some scattered teaching methods. A lot of ""real life"" examples stretched across several chapters that in my opinion became a scattered approach.Probably the most novel idea that came across was that it's better to be a ""good enough"" parent than a perfect one. By Klein's opinion, if you manage to be the perfect parent, you set a standard so high that your child will have anxieties trying to live up to your example. Not sure I'm 100% with that, but it is an interesting take on parenting.

A way to chart your course is taken from Alan Lakein's ""How to get control of time and your life"", which is an excellent book. Strategies for dealing with misteps are also covered.The author tries overtly to avoid religion, but a slight Christian undertone runs through the book, probably unintentionally because of the author's and those he quotes cutltural background.

"Mathematical nonsense: Mathematically speaking, this book is all nonsense. For instance, the author argues that owning a home is more expensive than not owning. This is true if you compare a person living under a tree versus one owning a home. He argues that the person owning a home has a negative cash flow of 8k per year all due to the interest he pays on mortage. But the details he left out (just to make his useless point) is, the person who owns a home has a home to live for a few hundred more bucks a month, whereas the person who doesn't own a home has to pay may be 10-15k per year for rent. That wipes out the savings that the author is claiming. Not only that, that money is down the drain since it goes to the landlord, whereas the owner of the home builds equity.My recommendation is to stay away from this nonsensical book, else you will be screwed if you follow his advice.

Some of the rhythm patterns have a Latin flavor and feel very danceable. Others remind me of chill out lounge music. A few selections have some subdued vocals that are more part of the background rather than the foreground. I enjoyed the selections and liked working with them in the background. I have not heard the other volumes in the series and so I cannot compare them with each other. My only reservations about this collection is that the mood between selections is not always consistent, some are more mellow and some are more lively. But the mood of the CD is more consistent than a lot of collections I have heard. Some of the pieces are more experimental than the others and are interesting studies. Two of them felt slightly dissident to me, but the experimental sound still felt worth hearing.

"I do not recommend this vacuum: We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner.

"More Fiction than fact: Donal Cline clearly demonstrates his inability to distinguish fact from fiction. I find his book to be biased (towards the Murphy-Dolan faction), poorly researched (claiming that Billy the Kid was known as Michael McCarty), and his findings to be very questionable (presents evidence without veryfiable sources.)After reading this book I asked myself why did Cline write this book? He seems to not think to much of ""Billy the Kid"" so why write a book about him? Why not stick to your true passion and write a documentary about James Dolan and L.G. Murphy.

"Typical Thomas video, all about James: THe biggest problem with this DVD is the order of the episodes as someone has complained about in many other video reviews. Several episodes specifically refer to an episode where a bootstrap is used on James's brake line. The episode in which this actually occurs is one of the last on the DVD. It would have taken like 10 more minutes to have the videos play in chronological order. Other than that it is a good DVD with 8 Thomas and Friends stories in which James is prominent. I have a personal complaint too. I purchased this in a store not online. Even though the box said it includes a bonus WOODEN train. My box actually had a TAKE ALONG Bertie in it. My son didn't have a Bertie so I was eager to get it but I didn't realize it was a metal take along kind not a wooden series. My son has no other take along items because we think the wooden series is far better.

"Inexpensive but poor quality: The set was shipped with a carrying case that was covered in an oil-like substance and either the oil or the case itself smelled horrendous. Also, the punches are very dull and not uniformly sharpened (or dulled, however you look at it). I have difficulties cutting through even thin, soft silicone sheets. Sharpening them with a rotary tool helps, but I feel I shouldn't have to do that with a brand ""new"" product (which I am sure is actually repackaged).

"Deserving of the Pulitzer it won; but don't be scared by it.: Remnick won the Pulitzer for this unwrapping of 70 plus years of communist control of a collection of nations. In depth, he discusses the purges, the environment and events that allowed them to occur, the Russian view of the Patriotic War (WWII), the rise and fall of communism. Communism was doomed from the start. Here, Remnick explains exactly why. The Russian people are wonderful, I've met many of them. This book also gives the reader an understanding of the world in which they grew up. A world where Stalin was (literally) God. A world without independent thought. Fascinating, heart wrenching. Very readable.

"A peek inside the process.: First thing's first, ""Homespun"" is an album of demos for ""Apple Venus"". If you don't have that record, look there first (although if you're new to XTC, ""Skylarking"" is the usual recommendation).So a collection of demos, what to expect? Essentially it's a track-by-track match for ""Apple Venus"". Sonically, you couldn't tell it's so much a set of demos except in a couple places (""Frivolous Tonight"") because it sounds so complete, in fact to the point where some pieces sound virtually identical to their final takes-- even in places you wouldn't expect it like orchestral workouts ""River of Orchids"" and ""Green Man"".Is it interesting? Yeah, extremely, and in a lot of places it can be as good or better than the original (""Knights in Shining Karma""), but truth to be told, unless you're a diehard, you probably don't need to hear the work versions of this material. More casual fans definitely want to check out ""Apple Venus"", it's a fine record.

"a worthy addition to WW II Eastern Front histories: I've read a tremendous amount on the subject of WW II history, so very rarely do I read a book with anything new to tell me. This book is in that class and well-written too. The two points I found interesting were the discussion of the original focus of Hitler's 1942 campaign in Russia and the first extensive history I've read about the airlift effort to save Paulus' 6th Army trapped at Stalingrad. He offers original research into 1) the question of just who promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe could sustain 6th Army by airlift, and 2)just how successful the Soviets were in interfering with the airlift. For anyone interested in the history of WW II on the Eastern Front, this book is a must read.

"Effective book for discussing physical death with a child: As a public school librarian, I would say that ""Lifetimes"" is an effective picture book for an adult to share with a child (or children) in dealing with the subject of death. However, as a person of faith, I would add that the scope of this book is limited to earthly life and therefore does not touch on the belief in life after death.The text states: ""Nothing that is alive goes on living for ever."" This statement either reflects the authors' intent on only dealing with the concept of physical death, or it could be interpreted as their belief statement. This is why I'd suggest that ""Lifetimes"" be read by, or shared with, a caring adult who would be able to answer a child's questions based on a family's belief system.

"Not What I'd Hoped For: I had expected, or at least hoped for, a more or less straightforward account of the Mothman phenomenon of some 30 years ago.

I was pleasantly surprised to find nineteenth century photographs of the peninsula in its true heyday. Having lived in Arverne during the 1960's and 70's, I was amazed to see that the rich and famous visited this area very similar to the way the rich and famous today visit the Hamptons on the east end of Long Island. As you view the postcards from this early era, you can actually see the unspoiled landscape of sand dunes and bay marshes that no longer exist. And the magnificent hotels and homes that graced this once popular resort prove to me that the City of New York truly mis-managed the development since the 1930's.

"Repetitive and monotone: I really wanted to like this book based on the title and the cover art. Instead, I found myself not caring about the narrator whatsoever. She repeats the same few thoughts throughout the entire book. She reminds the reader that her mother is dead and that nobody loves her so many times that I stopped caring about her situation. Her repetition and monotone voice stops the narrator from being truly developed as a character that we can connect with. Some parts of her story seem unnecessary and pointless as they don't really lead to anything of interest later on. Her characterization was too direct and left nothing for the reader to consider for themselves. The title is extremely misleading as we learn absolutely nothing about her mother- aside from her death during childbirth. I am unable to find anything positive to describe about this book, sadly.

"Love these glasses: I love these Anchor Hocking glasses. My parents have had a set of this pattern for years. When I moved into my own place in college and was tired of the free plastic cups I had I went to the store and found these glasses. I have 8 big glasses in a blue color, but I'm wanting matching in a smaller glass and can't seem to find the same color. Anyway, I really like that the squares help you hold the glass easier. Also, these glasses are very stable, don't tip easily. Plus, they are bottom heavy but not too bottom heavy, that way they don't slip out of your hands as easily. I have broken many other glasses cause they were too bottom heavy, but I have never broken one of these.

"Forsyte Saga - a well awarded but oft forgotten classic: I'll make this short and to the point. I'm quite the avid reader, but usually I don't enjoy books of this nature, opting for fantasy and sci-fi escapism instead. This story is just beautifully told though. The subtleties of the characters and the twisting lives of the Forsyte family are fascinating and makes this one helluva a page turner. I was hooked immediately. I honestly believe that people of all ages will love this book, and I urge you to give it a shot! I know sometimes that novels taking place in this particular era can seem daunting for those of us who crave more ""Adventure! Action!"" type books, but there is no lack of excitement here!

"The book is great but the edition is an embarrasment: ... for Oxford University Press. There are quite a few annoying typos. I can see how the new Forsyte by the name Scames or the unlisted French word ""ficbe"" came about as a result of faulty character recognition, but how Soames, born in 1855, got to be thirty-eight in in 1885, is beyond me. Don't they have proof-readers anymore?By all means read the book--you may find out how a lot of later works of literature derive from it--but not in this edition.

"Expensive experiment that didn't work: I was hoping for an acid that was convenient to use. Well, this is pretty convenient, just swipe. But it did nothing for me. I wanted to try and get rid of the little bumps clogging my pores and frequent breakouts. However, my skin remained the same. And while it doesn't really have a scent, there seems to be some chemicals wafting off the pads that affected my sinuses because I have quite a sensitive nose. I switched to using them on my back and got the same result, which was nothing. So it was an expensive experiment that didn't work. It may work for someone else but it did nothing for me. Most disappointing. I have since switched to the salicylic gel peel, which hurts a whole lot more, but gets the job done.

"Small type: My review centers on only one thing - the type size. This edition is disappointingly and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily small. Increasing the type size a point or two would move the edition from unreadable to readable and, at most, increase the book length by about a hundred pages. Since it is currently at almost 500 pages, I feel quite certain the binding could accommodate another 100 pages with no problem.What makes it all the more frustrating is that the type itself is a nice clean face that wouldn't require a magnifying glass if it was just a little larger.I really don't believe Our Lord meant for us to suffer eye strain to read His word; nor do I think He wants us to carry around large books when small books with readable type would serve the (His) purpose.

Ironically, the one intolerable element is the relatively new colony set up in a clear-cut space by humans with corporate minds and driven by more motives than just sheer greed,Alan Dean Foster is one of my favorite authors - though I remain envious of his imagination, writing skills, and the interesting life he has fashioned for himself.

Her father discovers he is descended from aristocracy and drinks himself into a stupor, unable to fulfill his obligations. Tess takes his place and, through a series of misfortunes, is sent away to rich 'relatives' with the hope of getting financial assistance for her family. She meets a rogue at the mansion, and is taken in by him in so many ways. Fast forward. She meets another man and falls in love. Through their tragic love story, much is discovered about the morality, rules, and expectations of Victorian society.Thomas Hardy has brought to life amazing characters in this work, and he has conceived a story which will embed themselves into the psyche as one contemplates this work again and again. It's a beautiful love story, and so much more. Highly recommended!

"Unbearable Lightness of Being-- Unbearable Yet Enjoyable: In an Age of Communist Oppression, we see a side of Daniel Day-Lewis reminiscent of the lovable letch 'Newland' in The Age of Innocence. Daniel plays perfectly a doctor living in Prague, who cannot tolerate oppression-OR resist women, and both influences drive him to do the unimaginable. It's amazing seeing two main rivals for his affections manage NOT to kill each other-as they pussyfoot around the painful truth. Lena Olin (Sabina) is the perfect seductress in her famous bowler hat-and one can easily love as well as hate her, as she tries to deceive the ever wise Tereza Tomas' wife (Juliette Binoche). Thumbs up to Tereza who acknowledges what Tomas cannot- as she forces him to face his weakness-and their love provides a measure of redemption. Still, it's Tomas' decision to return to Prague that results in terrible consequences. If not for the needless eroticism, this would have been a 5 star movie.

"Please read Kundera's book instead: Kundera's novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being is absolutely amazing, and this film falls so far short of it. Despite my almost-immediate dislike of the film, I actually stuck it out and watched the entire thing (hoping that Daniel Day-Lewis could somehow salvage it or that the film might actually express some idea from Kundera's book). But I was sorely disappointed.But please read Kundera's novel, because it is wonderful. I can't help but think that Kundera was referring to this film when he wrote in his later novel Immortality: ""The present era grabs everything that was ever written in order to transform it into films, TV programs, or cartoons. What is essential in a novel is precisely what can only be expressed in a novel, and so every adaptation contains nothing but the nonessential.""

This film explores the difference between the two, and the pain that one causes the other by his ""lightness of being"".Towards the end the movie becomes a tearjerker, so be ready to cry your eyes out.

"Prose-Poetry to inspire: I agree with most of the positive reviews on this book and although I am a little biased (Kerouac is my favorite author), this book inspired me to write a poem after I finished reading it. And although it may not inspire you to do anything at all, it is that good that it could inspire something positive in your life or even in your viewpoint or artwork if you're an artist. I read ""On The Road"", ""The Town and The City"", and just before this one, ""The Subterraneans"", which I found really great but quite difficult to read without having blood run out of your ear from sentences that were 2 or 3 pages long !

"On the Road To Enlightenment: Less plot, more pot than On the Road. Where Kerouac's most famous novel was all about reckless travel, music, girls, and rebellion, Dharma Bums is more introspective.

"Flat Kerouac: I'm amazed at how many people find the Dharma Bums worth reading. It's Kerouac at his flattest. The sentences lack his usual energy and lyrical beauty, there is virtually no action and the Buddhist philosophy feels pasted on and contrived. This is definitely not a Kerouac book to recommend. Readers would to better to pick up a copy of Desolation Angels or (excepting the 140 pages of transcribed conversation in the middle) Visions of Cody. If you've already read lots of Kerouac and you want to move on to a modern counterpart, pick up Vincent Czyz's Adrift in a Vanishing City ... lyrical, experimental, hot-house writing that takes a quick-talkin drifter out of his native Kansas as far afield as Berlin, Mexico City and Paris. And through it all, he never loses his vernacular, even when waxin metaphysical. You might also try sliding over to Henry Miller ... not Tropic of Cancer, which is his most popular, but Sexus, which is far better written.

I was also confused during a lot of the movie and had trouble figuring out who a lot of the Decepticons were because they seemed very similar.

The filmmaker is smart as he gave the lion's share of the line to Mr. Patrick. He plays a great, sarcastic bad guy, plain and simple. John Cena can act in the sense that Arnold Schwarzenegger can act. Mr. Cena lets his actions do the speaking, thankfully.

"good idea, good looks, needs lots of work: I recently purchased the eMarker by Sony. It shows how far technology has come it also shows how useless some of afformentioned technology can be. It looks great attached to my keyring. Needless to say with it's sleek stylish good looks it attracts lots of attention. The main problem is its lack of extremely useful features. I hope Sony makes some revisions and releases a better more useful product like we have come to expect from them.

"Totally Useless: I too bought into the hype that the emarker presented, but after using it for a week I realized how pathetic this product is. Its nothing more than a clock that marks the time of day you here the song and NOTHING ELSE! You have to look up everything manually including the radio station and the appropriate time. Not only that but you have to memorize which mark stands for which station, it doesnt even do that!! How stupid, does sony believe they can just sell products by putting their name on it. Tsk Tsk. The product is also really dependent on the internet, so if you dont have a good connection like me you can forget the practicality of the emarker. Actually, even if you do have a cable or dsl line, its still useless.

"worthless: Where is the space for a zero star! Just purchased a emarker and ill tell you one thing, I should have read these reviews first. All the bad you hear about this little thing is true. I am not priveliged enough to live in an area Sony feels compelled to offer service in, so I dont even have one station to mark. The site is terrible and I cant even get the program to ""enable"" itself. Whats the difference though, cant do anything with it anyway. This is typical Sony. My advice, check out all the ratings here and go to the website and see if they even offer any stations in your area. Believe me, they wont tell you it will not work in your area. It, however, is a neat idea. Needs lots of work.

"Another thingabob on a key chain: E-marker started to lose it's appeal when I had a problem with the driver. Sony provided little assistance with the situation and I basically had to solve it through trial and error. The website was easy to manuever through, but receiving the proper listings wasn't constant. I will give Sony credit for coming up with the idea, and respect it's potential. However, for now it serves as a interesting eye candy piece for my key chain.

"Don't buy this Junk: Before buying this product I read all the reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't pay enough attention to the warnings that the product doesn't work. I thought I could trust a company like Sony to deliver a reliable product and figured that the poor reviews were the result of consumer error. I was wrong. The complementary reviews on this site just can't be real. The product looks nice but works like a piece of junk.

"Absolutely ruined it.: As a child I would stare at the Gammell's illustrations while re-reading each story over and over. The illustrations made this book much more imaginative and influential in my opinion. The new illustrations do not do this beloved set justice. I am extremely disappointed to find out that the original is out of print. Don't buy this for yourself or your kid. I loved these books so much when I was a kid, that I am actually going to write a letter (ON PAPER! with a stamp!!) to Harper Collins telling them about the role that crazy art had on my imagination and development as a creative person. Jeez. Absolutely terrible, the new illustrator must have no dignity to ruin this.

Upon searching for the other tales of horror by Alvin Schwartz, ""In A Dark, Dark Room"", which was written for Level 2 of the ""I Can Read!"" children's collection, I found those water-colored images to be scarier than the cartoonish images in the re-release of ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.""

"Disappointed: This video was let down. The historical blurb at the beginning is a time waster, and a pain to fast forward thru every time I want to practice dancing. I agree with other reviewers regarding the time devoted to ""freestyle"" and ""improvisation"". I am too new at this to recognize the moves when they are put together so quickly- and without any commentary. I find myself struggling during this part, or worse - just standing there feeling frustrated and foolish. Some instruction regarding transitions from one move to another would have been appreciated. On the positive side, the actual breakdown of moves was very helpful, especially the belly roll and undulations. I was really struggling with those, and I'm now confidently on my way. I wish they had covered more moves in that manner. Bottom line- it's been a week, and I'm already seeking out another video to buy.

That book was excellent, and I wanted to have the latest version.Unfortunately, what I received was a much more expensive ""pamphlet"" (only 160 pages for over ten dollars) that abounds with typographical errors, to the point that the errors change the meaning of the sentence in several places. As if that weren't enough, much of the content appears to have been cribbed from various blogs and Web pages that can be read for free after a simple Google search.To sum up: The 1993 version of Armed and Female is a well-written and interesting resource, albeit slightly dated in technical recommendations on ammunition, calibers, and of course the makes and models of available handguns.THIS book is unfortunately only an overpriced, badly printed rehash of information available elsewhere.

"Ryan's Revenge: A surprisingly bad film, painfully slow paced and convoluted. It really is one hell of a mess. The exploitation of a pitiful malformed character (played by John Mills) is so over the top, insensitive, and with a tasteless comic bent, and so frequently employed, that it demands mention. The story feels minor to begin with, but is so disjointed and inane, that it is best described as no story at all. The music is hard to describe, I'll be kind, it's not helpful. The only reason to see this film is for the absolutely gorgeous, almost hypnotic cinematography. That and perhaps a young and radiant Sarah Miles. That should have been enough to save this film with some tough and aggressive editing, and just a little devotion to good taste. But instead we are forced to endure some kind of a personal or career psychosis by a great director, David Lean.

"Excellant movie and seller: I saw this movie when it first came out, it was hauntingly beautiful. I am so happy to get it on DVD. Some may find it a little slow in areas, but I loved it. If you appreciate the work of David Lean, and the acting of Sarah Miles and Robert Mitchum, then you will love this. It ranks right up there for me with Dr. Zhivago, which I also had the pleasure of seeing when it first came out on the big screen. A wonderful epic movie.

Even a woman with fighting skills.

Yet, he continues to chase her, help her and love her regardless. When everything is added up, Moriah doesn't deserve a man like Sabin.

I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history.

"Fantastic Sci Fi Classic: The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite.

"Phenomenal: I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change.

"Good politics, but no science: The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction.

The story seemed tacked on to the series just to write another novel.

"Great Writing: I think the above review needs a corrective. Tynan was the sharpest, funniest, and best-informed theatre critic of his generation. He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography. Well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters, and a must for Tynan fans. when can we have some more of his work reisssued?

Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom.

This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film.

Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as ""The Road Warrior.""

The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen.

Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!

You can bet I'll never buy anything from this vendor, even if it is a great deal.This is a ridiculously high price for Red Bull. On sale in the stores one can find it for $1.50/can. Why would someone pay more than that online? Caveat emptor --- let the buyer beware!

"Where are the woodwinds?: The performances seem fine. The recording is a mess. The woodwinds are LOST in the intro to Festive Overture because there is too much reverberation. The mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall (more like a cavern). This is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding. This is a one listen CD... then file it away forever.

"Vivid colors; tight fit only lasts a few times: This puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction. As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual ""guide."" The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects. We are happy customers!

"Persuasive book with an unusual approach: The book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice. In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.

"Another Sensual Gem from this Composer: This is yet another lush, shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by Franz Schreker, wonderfully performed by the forces involved -- I suggest you just read the review of 02/12/04 to get a good summary of the surreal plot. At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.

It didn't take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake.Returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton (because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough).

"Intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop: We bought these beds in September for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. They are 6 and 7 and weigh under 50 pounds. These beds can not make it through one single night inflated. We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is ""save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on"", that's what we're doing now.

"Disappointed but shouldn't be surprised: I saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase. We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.

"Would not recommend: I bought this for my off campus residence, and the two months it worked fine...and then the problems began. First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.

"Better than the Queen size bed: I bought this to replace my queen size Intex bed that exploded inside (only lasted 6-8months...). I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside. The twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger. If you're looking for a bed for just yourself, this should be perfect!

"Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum ""my first vibrator"" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more ""lifted"" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!

It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 ""generations"" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.

"Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice.

"A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson ""in his own words"" but were nothing more than fabrication.

"Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.

The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.

"Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of ""Portrait of a Marriage"" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call ""The Three V's."" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.

"Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt.

"a childhood favorite: In ""The Greengage Summer"" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.

This formula was tested and contained no mycotoxin citrinin (thought to cause chronic kidney disease in the Balkans where this toxin is found in high levels) a dosage of three pills a day should be a good start and is the minimum effective dosage shown to work in clinical trials.I would also recommend taking a CoQ10 supplement like Q-gel which is solubilized in polysorbate 80, for excellent absorption.

"It does not use your classification for the musics.: I organize all my files into folders. However this device ignores my classification and sort all files by artist and album. There is no way to configure the device so I can browse my music through my folders.Moreover, there is no easy way to create a playlist. To do that you have to install the software that cames whith it and you can not add new musics to the playlist in another computer. All playlists editions must be done in the same computer. This is a huge limitation for me because I use a lot of different computers (home, office, notebook,...). I haven't bought an Ipod because it has the same limitations. Futhermore, the software that comes with it is terrible, much worst than Itunes.So if you organize your files into folder and would like to use this classification in your mp3 player, and if you don't want to buy an Ipod because you will be tied on in a specific computer, you SHOULD NOT BUY this device.

"Informative but idiosyncratic coverage of historical warships: This book offers an interesting diagrammatic presentation of thirty-six warships, ranging from a Roman galley to a ""Nimitz""-class aircraft carrier. Naval buffs will find this a useful book, with numbered guides accompanying the cut-away color diagrams that offered details about the layouts of the various ships. Yet the selection of what constitutes a ""great"" warship is rather idiosyncratic. The selection is exclusively Western in its orientation, as Chinese junks, Ottoman galleys or Imperial Japanese Navy vessels completely absent. Moreover, the compilers seemed to have been unable to decide whether a great warship was an innovative one or a historic one and included selections of both, leaving out others more deserving in the process. As a result, while an interesting resource, it is a limited one that lacks a theme that could have made it a truly valuable book.

Scylla looks like 1930's cartoons.I drew better stuff in 1st grade.Every single scene looks so fake it isn't even funny. I can probably get more entertainment watching an earthworm. I would not recommend this to anyone young or old. This movie isn't worth a penny in my book!

"Crap, all crap: ...you would have noticed how horrible the allusions are in this crap-that-calls-itself-a-movie. The characters were simply annoying; Telemakhos, the whiny school boy that cries whenever he doesn't get his way, creepy Athena, who's eyes are SUPPOSED to be gray, Penelope, who obviously has a more pleasureful time on the water on the beach than with her husband, and of course Odysseus, who would make me weep if he was my captain. The sets looked as if elementary school kids put them together, Scylla was a sock-puppet, and the shades were just sad. I have never in my life seen such crap and I hope you won't fall for these other 4-star reviews that make me want to PUKE!

"Very BORING: This movie was very boaring. I really didnt enjoy it at all. It was to gory. I just dont enjoy when people kill. I also dont enjoy when people dress like old stone age, and dont enjoy the anceint times they were rough and crewl times. The movie the odyssey took place in Greece back thousands of years ago when there was such things as mythical creatures. I really dont enjoy things like that others might. Although , there is a part I did like. I enjoyed the part of the movie when calypso(Venessa Williams) kept odysseus on the island for two years she nor her maids had not seen a man for 100 years. I thought that was very interesting. The other parts of the muvie confuse me and the names confuse me such as: Penelope(Greta Scacchi), Athene(Isabella Rossellini), Cyclopes(Reid Asato), and Eurybates(Ron Cook). Those were just a few. So all in all I would give this movie one star. I f you like movies like this then its great and go watch it but if you dont its not a movie for you as you can see.

"Birds, Beasts and Relatives: As always, Gerard Durrell's works make me want to hop on a flight to Greece right now. His imagery of the lush flora and fauna there make it seem irresistible to anyone, especially small boys. Though it was an enjoyable read, it seemed a bit too similar to My Family and Other Animals, as though this sequel was everything he had forgotten to put into the first one, which is exactly what the author states in the introduction. This book seemed to focus a bit more on the animals, less on the comical family, and though sea life is fascination, crustaceans do get a bit old. This book is very relaxing to read, and almost makes you feel like you are a little boy again. Slow paced and funny, this enjoyable book put Corfu at the top of my list of places to go.

"I Don't Think So!: Quite often, bringing a classic story like ""Moby Dick"" to the screen is a thankless task. But at least John Huston's 1956 version has a lot of class as well any number of great performances (even Moby Dick looked a lot more realistic in 1956!). This version just doesn't make it - skip it and buy a copy of Gregory Peck's rendition instead. You'll be glad you did.

"Great Series opener: I picked up this book used for a couple dollars while on vacation and spent the rest of my vacation reading it. I rated this book 4 stars because even though I found it to be very enjoyable, I seemed to easily figure out where the plot was heading, Nevertheless, I was still surprised by the ending. I found the tension between hester and Monk to be both intriguing and frustrating, especially when it was not resolved at the end of the book. Needless to say, I was delighted to discover that there are 11 (soon to be 12) more books in the series. I plan to read them all.

After a year and a half the first one stopped working. Best I can tell, the Hard Drive just failed. The cost for fixing makes it smarter to buy a new one - so I trashed it. A few months later the second one stopped working altogether also. I absolutely love the machine but there is obviously some problme with the hard drives.

I suffered the undue consequences of going off ""cold turkey"" when I needed to taper off. In actuality those meds ARE GF, and always were!!!If you want the facts (as boring as they are) -- dont rely on this book.

There is nothing in this book for a parent in the thick of childrearing. Although they are completely out of date with respect to political correctness and product availability, the series from the Gesell Institute (Your One Year Old, Your Two Year Old, etc. etc.) provides immensely better insight into what is going on with children at particular ages and stages. ""Raising Your Spirited Child"" is a much better place to start looking for advice getting along with a difficult child or even an average difficulty child.

"Politics?: A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.

"Motown Heaven -- The Soundtrack for Boomers!: This 3 CD album is a wonerful collection of the ""best"" of Motown, in which the Holland/Dozier/Holland tagline under the title of the record meant high quality R&B;, and almost always resulted in a mega-hit. The collection begins with the very earliest hit -- Eddie Holland singing ""Jamie"", and proceeds through most of the major early hits of The Miracles, The Supremes, Martha and the Vandellas, Mary Wells, The Marvalettes, The 4 Tops, the Isley Brothers, and more.This CD replaces my old collection of 45 RPM recordings, and has allowed me to enjoy the Motown Sound without haaving a huge number of CD's to collect. The one downside about this wonderful collection is that the 3rd CD contains mostly less well-known tunes, with the exceeption of two Diana Ross/Supremes cuts: ""My World is Empty Without You"" and ""Forever Came Today"". In all, the collection is a terrific value and brings back fond memories: The soundtrack to my teenage years; Rock On!!

What is so ironic about the case is that the cousins were going to the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge to read an anti-racism poem written by one of the victims, only to be brutally murdered by a gang of the minorities that she was probably referring to.A very fast and good read.

"Somewhat worked for 30 days....now starting to fail: Update...so the workaround described below work for about 33 days...just outside the return window. The tracks that play in just the left headset channel do not come through. I've tried 2 sets of ear buds and one set of over the ear headsets...all have the same issue. Plug the same headsets into the source (PC), all channels play out of both ear.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM.---Out of the box, if I plug my ear buds from my iPhone into the extension (fully connected in the female end) I only get sound out of the right ear bud. Verified the same condition with a pair of JVC ear buds as well. I have found if you insert the male end of the headphones into the extender to the first ""click"" (not fully inserted), sound comes from both ear buds. There is tension with it connected in this fashion, so it works but could be better. Others may have better luck with other headphones.

"If life is a dream, then don't wake me up: This book is a watershed in human intellectual history. In it Freud undermines the picture of mankind as primarily a being of reason, and presents the idea that we are all creatures of our wishes, our inner unconscious lives. Dreams are not nothing, and they are not in Freud's eyes rare religious gifts, but rather to the key to our own mental life. Freud in this book presents a vast world of examples and interpretations .I am not a psychologist and do not consider myself competent to really judge how much of what Freud presents here is valid or even capable of scientific testing. I do know that this work is one which like a great literary masterpiece has inspired countless interpretations and reinterpretations.Understanding human Intellectual History is now impossible without knowing this work.

"Barely Unbeatable Theory: Freud's ""The Interpretation of Dreams"" is a unique book. His treatise on human dreams is truly a product of a brilliant mind. But neither the process of creation itself nor not the results and findings it brought out are the true wonders of this book. The great achievement of Freud's theory is its immunity to criticism. In other words, it is virtually impossible to criticize the results and propositions inserted in this book. His main tenet - a dream is a fulfillment of a desire - cannot be attacked in any intelligible way. If one says for instance that an unpleasant dream or a bloody nightmare is clearly not the fulfillment of a desire, Freud would promptly mention masochism or self punishment. Or, if one finally brings forth a dream that is surely not a desire fulfilled, he might nonetheless say there is at least a desire accomplished, viz: the desire to destroy Freud's dream theory.

"One of the best of the Marco Polo Josef Strauss series.: This is one of the best of Marco Polo’s Josef Strauss Edition. Mika Eichenholf allows to quick polkas to gallop fleetly, the march has plenty of swagger, the polkas mazur have poise, and there is a lilt and a joy in the waltzes that make you welcome rather than dread the many repeats. Josef Strauss often succeeded in creating dances in the minor key, but there are none of them here. What is here is his last composition, the “Hesperus-Bahnen Waltz”, published as Op 279, after the forty-three year old composer’s death.

"Sure she's a little annoying... BUT.: Yes, by reading every review we all know by now that Sheri is a wee bit annoying, and her ""participants"" are an interesting sort of people, AND YES it did put my husband in a coma like trance everytime we watched it. BUT everything in this DVD is so valuable! I learned everything I needed to know through this DVD without taking more time off work to go to classes. And since it was always available to me by the touch of a button I was able to review the important things while I was acually in labor. I had to kill time waiting for my contractions to be 5 mins apart before we went to the hospital, so I popped in the DVD, and trust me my husband was no longer in a trance, he was taking notes! This was my first child and thanks to Sheri my labor was only 12 hour and I only pushed for 20 mins, 3 good ones and he was out! I think doing what Sheri says and waiting till your dialated 5 cm before you get an epideral was really key.

"TH E MOST ANNOYING WOMAN ON EARTH: I'm sure this woman has lots of valuable info to impart, but we could barely watch this DVD. Sheri Bayles is sooo annoying and unfunny that we fast forwarded through the whole thing, trying to cling on to pieces of important information. Even the people taking the class seem embarassed for her. Avoid this DVD unless you think you can look past a nurse who thinks she's a stand up comedian. I wish I had another to suggest.

"GO FOR IT!: This tape is simply fun and informative. I am not even pregnant or expecting to have to conceive anytime soon but I had to watch this. (I'm a woman, why not?) The lady is so corky and yet serious enough to have you practically writing notes like your in a college. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in REALLY learning about childbirth. She explains everything. How your body should be functioning, what is stretching, what liquids to look for as signs of this and that, charts of how the baby is actually sitting and how exactly it's growing and she even quizzes the husbands! There is so much to learn. Open a bag of kettle corn and grab a pillow though, it's like four or five hours long. PHEW. But it probably wouldn't be best to watch it all in one sitting anyway. It is a lot of information to grasp. Enjoy!!

I did not have a doula or a midwife...just my husband, an awesome nurse and this DVD. I enjoyed being able to watch it in the comfort of my own home and go back to certain parts to rewatch. It's a bit OUTDATED, and CHEESY, but overall very honest and good. Worked for me. If anything, its worht the few $$ for reference AFTER a birthing class.

You just feel bad for the main character through most of the book and there is no redemption at the end. It has the worst ending ever! It still pisses me off that I spent the time reading it. There isn't really much of a story, just a lot of details and weird issues. There are too many tangents and the protagonist is the only character with ANY sort of common sense.

Unfortunetaly I was on vacation when I started it, so I had to stop reading, but I would have read it in a day! I quickly bought the other books in the series and read, each one better than the next, although the Clan of the Cave Bear was ultimatly the best one. I'd recommend the series to someone over the age of 13. It would be hard to follow if you were younger, and some parts are inappropriate, especially in the following books. This was one of my favorite books, and be warned: once you start, its so hard to stop!

"Flyboys: Here is another example of Hollywood going wrong. The history that is implicated in the events portrayed in this movie is not all that tough to get right. Nevertheless, the film makers got a few details correct, but then added improbable special effects, far too many triplanes, annoying social lesson stereotypes, and a host of ridiculous story twists and time wasting baggage. Conceptually, the movie should have been a winner. In execution, it is a disappointment. They ruined a potentially good story. Instead of buying this movie, I would suggest the Blue Max as the aerial scenes are far better, or just propose that the would-be viewer read a history book.As a parting comment, however, I always have liked Jean Reno. He is the good part of this film.

It addresses issues like greed or Me-society that we often ignore. I'd like to stress out that Jesus pointed everything plainly for us. This book only reminds us to go back and look deeper within ourselves and question if God is really what motivates us in everything we do.I love this book and will give it to friends I know. Please pray for me so I can share it to others as well, and also put the Jesus' words into action.Thank God.

You can tell that he has grown up on this album. I think he is making a name for himself in the music business, and wont just be known as Brandy's kid brother. My fav tracks on this album are: 'Exotic' - love this song 2 bits cant get enough of it. 'In tha Mood', 'Anytime', 'One Wish', 'What I Need' and the crunk track 'Keep Sweatin'. However, there are a few dodgy tracks on there like 'Quit Actin' - i was excited when i saw R. Kelly was on there bt was sadly disappointed when i heard it. 'The War Is Over' - i liked the last duet they did 'another day in paradise' bt after hearing this song they should have stopped then. However, overall its a good album ... WELL DONE RAY J.

The part where we see who Tim really is, as opposed to who Tim's parents wanted him to be, was by far the best part of the book. The ""mystery"" though was just silly; there is no way that someone in England at that time when confronted with a child rapist wouldn't have murdered him on the spot. And Tim not doing so went completely against who the author had developed as Tim's true nature. There were actions such as this one throughout the book that seemed obviously placed in order to drive the plot forward. Exasperating and annoying.

"Too bad it's boring: The concept was good (and it certainly worked in Bayard's Poe novel). But after a half dozen chapters, I still couldn't care less about Tim. The prose tended towards the pedantic and the supporting characters were flat.

"Dissapointing after Into Thin Air and The Climb: After being nearly obsessed with Into Thin Air and The Climb, I eagerly awaited the latest book from Lene (I also lived in and speak Danish -- an added bonus). However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such. For gaining insight into the state of mind for Lene, it was interesting. For better writing and deeper analysis about the 96 tragedy, stick to the other 2 books.

"Don't bother!: This book is a total waste of time to read. I couldn't wait to read it when I saw it on Amazon.com. But lucky for me I happen to see it at the library and hurried home to read it. Gammelgaard is so into herself it makes me sick. To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with ""Into Thin Air"" or ""The Climb"". Also she has a style of writing that I have never seen before. She jumps from one thing to another, but I can guarantee you it will always be about herself, and how strong and great she is.
",1,1
"This is not a book about climbing Mt. Everest...: ...it's about being ""proud of being the first Danish woman to do so"" - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details).

Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?

"Good, but not great: When I first heard this album I loved it. After listening to it more closely, I still like it a lot, but am not quite so blown away by it. When it first came out, it might have been groundbreaking, but so much has happened since in the world of technical/avant-garde metal, that much of this album now sounds a little tame. The material hasn't aged very well. There are a couple of truly great songs in the middle-- all of the others are definitely good, just not mind-blowing (as some of the material on their older albums still is). The new vocalist on this album added a new dimension to the band-- a great improvement over Snake, in my opinion. If you want a truly great album, though, get their next, ""Phobos.""

The paper weight symbolizes the end of Winston and Julia's private and secure existence, which allow them to be safe with each other.

The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with ""Room 101"" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying.

"disturbing and relevant: I'm surprised that Noam Chomsky hasn't been mentioned in any of the 299 previous reviews. Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies. Chomsky gives very detailed descriptions of this.

"A Thoughtful Read: Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else.

I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment.

"two plus two makes FOUR!!!!: George Orwell imagined the future in a dull state where every single thought, emotion and action would be monitored by the government.1984 tells the story of Winston living in a socialist country, feeling depressed and then deciding to rebel.Orwell is able to convey the helplessness of Winston as well as his routine by use of short snappy sentences. However, as the plot thickens Orwell extends the sentences conveying Winton's hope and rebellion.1984 is truly captivating and rather depressing.

The story is very well written, it gives you a very good idea as to what a Dystopian world could potentially look like. Although at the beginning it does start out very slow, it is a very good read.If you read this book and enjoyed it, also take a look at ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley.

"Let's not pat ourselves on the back that this didn't happen.: I had 1984 ruined for me because I was FORCED to read it for school. Looking back, it is a truly great book. Like many of the enduring works of Science Fiction, its lasting popularity rests in the powerful archetpyes and metaphors it tapps into. Big Brother, The Two-Minutes Hate, Room 101 are all here. What's scary is how some of this seems to be coming true - but Big Brother isn't so much the government as it is Corporations. Just try getting away from a viewscreen nowadays. Also, we watch the TV, but the TV also watches US. Advertisers, the Internet, and MTV control us more thoroughly than the Government could ever hope to espire to. Instead of telling us ""We are at war with East Asia. We have ALWAYS been at war with East Asia!"" they tell us what our values are, what music we listen to, what movies we watch, etc. ""We listen to Britney Spears! We have ALWAYS listened to Britney Spears."" Orwell would've been so proud.

"Boring and depressingly morbid at the same time...: OK, maybe Mr. Orwell intended it to be this way, but it still doesn't hide the fact that this book moves incredibly slow compared to the author's other works. I read this book because I remember thoroughly enjoying and understanding Animal Farm years ago, and this work was recommended by several of my friends. If you want an unrealistic view of a future that is totally morbid and depressing, check this out. Yes, this is science fiction, and just because some people call it a classic doesn't mean I like it. If you want some of the best in this genre, I recommend 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, '2001: A Space Odyssey', by Arthur C. Clarke, or 'Enders Game', by Orson Scott Card.

Thank god you live in a country where you can be free to read this novel. The themes are as true today as when Orwell wrote them. The governments desire to control what people will think (See Clinton). Mans inhumanity to man (See Serbs and Kosovo). Children please read the newspaper once and a while.

"Start memorizing this book.: I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it.

Both of them have nothing to do with the story, and Ray Bradbury babbles on and on about his past and how he came up with the ideas for other books that NO ONE CARES ABOUT! I almost fell asleep during the forword, I dont know how I survived the book. The book drags on and one at a painfully slow pace. As for Ray Bradbury himself, he states in the introduction that in his eyes, Hitler burning and brutally killing people is on the same level as the burning of a book. I think that this statement is pretty much self explanatory for his views on humanity. Great guy, eh?

"Captivating language, needless to say amazing.: Being only a teenager, what I have to say usually means nothing, or gets no credit. I personally loved this book, reading it just a day ago. I was entirely captivated with the plot, and the idea of censorship in the future, and that it was precise that it being a book would be censored is unbelievable. What possesses any person to censor a book that is so realistic it is amazing. To actually prove to the writer that his writings are so precise is astonishing. I would recommend this to anyone. You don't need to love to read, just know how to read.

"Ok: I felt the author of the book should of described the war a little more. Still I thought it had some very interesting perspectives on how the world might become.I thought it was weird how all the fireman looked the same. The mechanical hound was a great part of the story. It had us guessing if it would attack Montag or not. Over all I felt this book was well worth reading.

"Excellent!!! My #1 book of all time!!!: I was actually forced to read this book for a high school english class, and fell in love with it. It's simply chilling in it's portrayal of the ""future"" and the deliberate ambiguity about Clarrise is very cool. The deeper themes in this book make it one completely rife with feeling.

"Very important book: This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history. The paralells that can be drawn from the story in this novel to the ""dumbing of America"" that is going on today are quite unnerving, and quite scary. This book should be required reading for everyone who has ever turned on the television to escape from the world (which is just about everyone in this country).

"It'll never go out of date: I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters? Is it more than just an oh-so-correct theme dressed up as a novel? Oh, yes it is! It's absolutely fantastic and I just plain can't recommend it enough.If you love sci-fi, great. If not, it doesn't matter. I can say ""transcends the genre"" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?

"Bleak, Blind, and Boring.: Being forced to read it in school for its ""so called""relation to censorship (sp?) I would have to say !!BURN IT!! Althoughthe book is about censorship and why/how it is wrong I can't say much good about it. The theme itself is good, but the story itself is trash. One of the most un-realistic ideas i've ever heard. First off, everyone in the country is an idiot. Second, that includes the hero. Third, even those who have minds of their own have no intellegence. And finally, way to many cracks in the foundation of the story and two many holes in the story itself.L8r.

"Fahrenheit 451, Burning Up My Brain: I read Fahrenheit 451 this year, in the seventh grade, as a required reading. As I read this book, I got more and more confused. The plot twisted and turned and left me hanging wondering ""wait... what happened?"". Mr. Bradbury used large words that I learned as vocab. I would recommend this book to no one under the age of about 13, maybe 12. I chose this age because of the hard concepts of burning books and the fast-moving plot of the hound.

"Sadly a disappointment: Perhaps it is dated. Perhaps it was just built up too much. But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did.

"A must read - especially for teenagers.: This is my first re-read of this book as an adult (I'm now 46). I recalled enjoying the book a lot when I first read it around the age of 17 - I recently recommended it to my daughter, age 14, and she thought it was one of the best books she ever read. My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too). It is hard to believe that this book was written in the 1950's.

"Good: ""Fahrenheit 451"" is set in a time where reading books is strictly forbidden. In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance. I overall liked this book, and would give it a 4/5

I have traveled to UK enough to know that the British people are generally quite polite, polished, reserved, and mannered. With the exception of The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down A Mountain (the only redeeming film in this collection; Hugh Grant portrays the real British style well) the makers of the other 7 have obviously visited Hollywood too many times and have drunk their Kool-Aid. The courseness, vulgarity, even offensiveness in dumbed-down run-on dialogue, babbling idiotic nonsense, and lack of plausible plot is not up to the usual British polish. The 7 films that lack class and levity of the usual British approach obviously came from the hog-pen of the U.S. cinema trough.

The capture feature works great and the the additional goodies...from cables to a nice remote controller are exceptional. I never use the enclosed driver disk with new hardware, and the 8500DV was no exception. There is not any reason not to download the newest drivers for the initial install... I have found it reduces many hassles. Speaking of hassles, I have had none with this card. Windows XP is such an improvement for handling complex components like the 8500DV, I would recommend it over hassling over a maxed out Win 98 system.

"A bit overrated. . .: Actually this isn't really even a movie, it's a really long music video. Maybe it's an advertisement, I don't know. All I can say is that a good movie requires a few things first and foremost: an engaging story and some interesting characters. This film lacks both. The director is a trickster of sorts who depends on neat stylized filming techniques and devices that attempt to cover up the fact that nothing's really happening plot-wise. Sorry, but the ""alternate-scenario"" theme just didn't work. At the end of the movie your left wondering why you bothered to even watch the first two thirds. Maybe I missed the point.

"Colleen - Colleen Et Les Botes À Musique: I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn't deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. ""What's is a Componium, Part 1"" goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it ""Charles's Birthday Card"" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, ""Will You Gamelan For Me?"" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on ""What's is a Componium, Part 2,"" a track that sparkles like moondust. ""Calypso in a Box"" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, ""I'll Read You a Story,"" which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere.

His tone may not be as big as Itzhak Perlman's, but it is nevertheless exquisite (the phrase ""spun silver,"" though cliched, is apt).

"Not a horror movie, a horrible movie: This movie personifies everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days. The characters are superficial, the plot anemic, and the special effects vastly overused. Liam Neeson leads a cast of characters who spend a few days in a haunted house to gauge their fear reaction. The house is possessed by the spirit of its builder, who hates kids. That is about it. A terrible remake of the original 1963 classic, which was the best horror film ever made. Get the original, and save your bucks by letting this one sit in the warehouse and rot.

"Absolute Crap!: Okay, if you're a special effects freak, you might like this. However, there are much better films with equally good effects. If you're a fan of minor things like say, oh... plot, character development, etc., then stay away! The 1963 Robert Wise film is the scariest film I've ever seen, and the scares come from what Wise DOESN'T show you. The '63 version was brilliantly plotted and paced, with one of the greatest ending lines in film history. The 1999 version has none of this. Do yourself a favor, and see the '63 movie, or better yet, read the Shirley Jackson novel. The only reason this gets one star is because C. Zeta-Jones is just SO easy on the eyes!

"A Truley Horrible Horror Film: A truly horrible horror film. Over use of not so special ""special effects"" attempted to divert our attention from the fact that the movie never gained any momentum, and that the characters were never developed or interesting.

The other thing that scares me about this movie is the reoccurring memory that I actually paid to see it.

"Too awful to be funny: I'll admit it was years ago when I had seen part of this movie remake that was SO bad, SO corny, SO awfully un-scary that I couldn't even continue to punish myself and barely made it half way through (and I, a lover of all things spooky!). I do recall however three things about this movie: the directing was awful, the script was terrible and Cathy Jones (I didn't know who she was - she hadn't married the old man yet which really launched her career) gave a performance that was particularly bile producing and one of the worst things about this movie. No! I speak in haste - there were a number of 'worst' things about this movie.If you want to be creeped-out, read the book (The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson). If you must see the story in movie form, watch the old black and white original from 1963 starring Julie Harris. It's dark and moody and may just give you a shiver or two along with a tinge of vertigo.Happy Hauntingness,Wind in Hare

It is technically a horror film, but it's really not that frightening (though there is a scene in the movie that made my mother jump about three feet), and as a result, is not for people that watch horror films for the fright. As a mystery, however, it is really quite good, and deserves to be watched over and over, just so you can find all the hidden clues for the answer at the end.

"...and what a feeble haunting it is!: No, no, no! What went wrong? Big-budget film with great actors, and what do we get? A visually appealing film with a completely flat Liam Neeson and a paper-thin storyline. Catherine Zeta Jones tries to charm her way through, but even though she does an okay job, the movie is still bad. Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson also try to add flavour to it all, but cannot manage to save the day. All we get is a movie with a few novelties but way too little content. It all seems to be over before it really begins, and nothing really makes much sense. And the eerie mood is almost totally absent. Not a good omen for a ""horror"" movie, is it?I just can't believe what went wrong for Neeson. Usually he drags a movie up, not down! Watch House on Haunted Hill instead, if you're into ""stuff-some-people-into-a-haunted-house-and-see-if-the-survive"" movies. Then you'll se how a proper haunting should be :)

"Catherine Zeta-Hipboots: A fan of both Jackson's novel and the 1963 Robert Wise adadptation, I went to this movie expecting it to be underwhelming. It was worse. In fact, it was so bad, I laughed my way through it (along with the two friends who accompanied me). There are so many digital effects that the house seems alive, indeed, but computer geeks set free with a big budget don't creep me out. They're just annoying. So is the movie. The house shape-shifts, sighs, moans--hell, even the door-knocker gets a reaction shot. Zeta-Jones's leather hipboots manage to out-act her, and Lili Taylor is hilariously bad as Eleanor. (""I've got the save the children!"" Wha?) Liam Neeson is even less interesting than he was in THE PHANTOM MENACE, if that's possible.

"IF IT AIN'T BROKEN, DON'T FIX IT: ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris was so good--even better for its black and white medium, which enhances the sense of the macabre and general off-kilterness of the set.

"It may be a modern-day classic to some, but not to me...: This 1999 horror film based on the original ""The Haunting"", is creepy in some ways, but altogether, it's not really a great film at all. It has good acting, and the scares and pop-outs are clever (things that boost my rating from a 1 to a 2), with an ending that isn't perfect, but really can hold the movie from completely falling apart. The film moves slow in the beginning, and it starts to pick the pace soon after, and later has it's intense ending. The film is OK in some ways, but ultimately becomes more of a fail than a win, but it still isn't horrible. I liked the house and the setting, though. That was cool. The complete storyline was pretty good, also. If you want some innovative horror from 1999, I suggest you get ""The Blair Witch Project"".

"Poor re-make of a good movie: I was originally looking forward to seeing this movie, but after I did, I wish I hadn't spent the money. The story is lame, the actors dull, and the story is so changed from Shirley Jackson's wonderful book, and the 1963 movie that it doesn't even deserve to share the same title. Forget about buying this botched movie and purchase the older 'Haunting.' You'll wonder why they bothered to make a re-make, proving that newer doesn't necessarily mean better.

"5 for the 1st, 4 for the 2nd: While I loved both movies, Jean de Florette and the sequel Manon of the Spring, I would rate the first of the pair to to have an edge over the second. They are both masterfully done, and you really can't watch just one of them, as they are an inseparable pair, the first movie forming the background for the second, and the second providing the resolution for the first. Without giving up too much of the story, these movies tell a story of greed, ""accidental"" murder, and resolution with the likes of Greek tragedy--critically and tenderly revealing the mysterious nature of the human heart. Two of the best set of movies ever in my lifetime. My only criticism of the 2nd movie is the weak portrayal of the young woman, which came down to either poor direction or perhaps a poor casting decision. Overall, this flaw can be overlooked, as these two movies will stand as classics for many years to come.

"Make sure you see Jean de Florette first: This is the second part of a two part series, and picks up where Jean de Florette leaves off. If you do not see Jean de Florette, then you will be missing much of the background of this movie, and the context is important. For example, without viewing the first movie, the viewer will not know Manons background, what happened to her father, and their farm. The viewer will also not know the full relationship she has with the Soubeyran clan.The quality of the DVD picture is avarage. The picture is fairly clean and clear.

"Columbian family values: Marquez' book takes the reader through the lives and times of what I hope is an atypical Columbian (?) family, covering from roughly the 1830s to the 1930s. It was fun in parts, but oddly repetitive, with a style that seemed half magic realism, half Freud. And, of course, the standard enervating anti-American diatribes were thrown in. I guess a Latin American author even in magic realism mode can't overcome his predilictions.

"500 pages of boredom: The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion. To give Marquez credit, his magical realism is a response to the limits placed upon him by the government he lived under, but it is, nevertheless, a poor literary form and when imitated purely awful), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.

"lesson in the depravity of man: As I opened this book, I thought to myself ""Wow! This seems like a great story!"" I found myself growing more depressed and disgusted with every page. Although the style and Marquez' technique are unquestionably wonderful, the overlaying themes of lust, lack of self-control, and immorality outweighed the good. The goal of nearly very character's life is the same; to please him or herself. Very few characters are in the least bit caring of self-sacrificing. The only way I could reconcile myself to reading this disapointing work was the fact that it is a lesson in man's depravity. I realized that every person, without God's intervention, is just as bad or worse than Marquez' perverse characters. The book is not without its high points- I loved the ending, the mystery of the Segundo twins, and Ursula's strength. There are some passages where the language is incredible. Marquez is a mastery of imagery! I only wish that there had been more positive images to remember....

"Excellent translation of Marquez's masterpiece: This translation of Marquez's quintessential work does great justice to his remarkable prose. The clarity and depth of Hundred Years' symbolism and the excellent development of the Buendia characters send the reader back to an austere but complicated time - a time of exploration, political upheaval, and social transition. One criticism of this translation is the absence of footnotes to specific historical, cultural, or social elements of life in Colombia in the past two centuries.""Taciturn, silent, insensible to the new breath of vitality that was shaking the house, Colonel Aureliano Buendia could understand only that the secret of a good old age is simply an honorable pact with solitude"" (p. 199).Overall, a great read!

"Kindle-Version of Bantam Classics un-readable: I was looking for a well-structured side-by side version of the Canterbury Tales. Bantam Classics normally does a great jobs on books, but whoever transcribed it to kindle did not know kindle at all, left it unstructured and the translation all over the place, intermingled with the lines, translating the wrong verses and generally just all over the place.Practically, I am reading four lines middle-english, five lines modern, three lines middle-english, 2 lines modern, 6 lines middle-english, and so forth.

"Beware of editions by General Books LLC: Beware of editions by General Books LLCThey produce books by scanning (OCR) copyright-free material, but without any editing.There are so many errors though that the result may be unusable.Usability probably depends on subject matter, but the many OCR-errors make even prose an annoying read.Especially mathematical and technical texts and texts with notes can become completely garbled.See the review of J.M.

"Tedious and Self-Inflating: I'm always up for another look at the Titanic, especially if new light is shed on the story. Unfortunately, Pelligrino spends a huge percentage of the book referring to himself admiringly in the third person, or subtly inflating his own worth in the parallel story line of Ballard's expeditions. On top of that, it's not interesting. The retelling of the events on the ship are fine, but they can't carry the deadweight of Pelligrino's attempt to make himself a central figure or as important as the story. It's the literary equivalent to watching an actor talk about how moved they are by their own acting. PASS.

When I watched the featurette about how hard they were looking for a lead actress and how excited they were to find Piper Perabo, I couldn't believe it! Perabo's acting was so annoying, she ruined the whole movie for me. Her fear of singing in public just became more and more irritating as the movie proceeded.

The second track had a rockier edge to it, and then slowed down with 'Medication'.

There's also playful pop-rock with ""Special"" (with Shirley tipping her hat to the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde at the end), the delirious ""Hammering In My Head,"" and the truly gorgeous ""You Look So Fine.""

"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !: There are many better yoga dvds to choose from. As a surfer, there is no special ""surf yoga"" as opposed to ""regular"" yoga. Any surfer who takes the time to practice yoga will benefit. Peggy's videos lack the vital instruction that beginners need to do poses properly without injury. It is a real shame as she has so many famous surfers supporting her efforts to spread yoga in the surf community. A better option is Shiva Rhea's Shakti yoga which provides excellent instruction AND a ""yoga matrix"" which allows you to create your own unique routines. Most DVDs become stale after awhile, but the yoga matrix on Shiva Rhea's dvd (in addition to the 4 ready-made routines), prevent this DVD from ever getting old.

"Another Bogus ""How to be a better surfer DVD."": This is perhaps the worst of all videos out today of its type. If you have a basic knowledge of yoga, you don't need this at all - you can create and tailor your own workout. If you don't know yoga, it's useless. The instruction is poor, peppered with a split screen of people surfing and practicing yoga (no wonder the surf mags think it's great!) with little, very poorly demonstrated techniques of basic yoga. In some scenes you can't even see their feet (a crucial failure) - even if the ""instructor"" says what to do. Save your money, take yoga long enough to learn it properly, then apply it to your own surfing. Yoga is great for surfing, but this is a poor video.

I liked the photographs which accurately depicted various professions/lifestyles in Nigeria and some of them provide wonderful ideas for story book extensions. For example, the photograph of the grandmother making a traditional outfit could be complemented by presenting to the children a few yards of woven fabric that is typically used in Nigeria for such outfits. Other professional roles we see Nigerians in are: BAKER, DOCTOR, WOOD CARVER/CARPENTER, LAWYER, POTTER, BLACKSMITH and FINALLY THE TRADITIONAL NATIVE DOCTOR or HERBALIST who gives us an excellent botanist lesson on plants and their healing properties. All in all, it paints Nigerians as an industrious people, which is what we are.

"Great summer read: This is the first book I've read by Meg Wolitzer, and overall, I enjoyed it. The plot brings three just-turned-thirty friends into close and prolonged contact with the 50-something mother of their recently deceased friend. Wolitzer is able to pull this off because she obviously likes all of her characters, their various flaws notwithstanding. She also has the type of sense of humor that allows her to ligthen things up when emotions and events threaten to drag things down too much. The strongest character is the Mother, Natalie, who is one of the more appealing baby boomers in recent fiction, and by no means a mere caricature. My only objection is that several secondary characters are not as clearly drawn as the main ones. But in fairness to Wolitzer, in most novels the reader would not even care about knowing more about such relatively minor characters, and it's only her gift for making you care that makes this an issue at all.

"Excellent Translation!: If you follow my reviews, you know that I am Anglo Catholic and that the 2 versions I use most are the ""Good News"" and the ORIGINAL ""Revised Standard."" I have respect for the ""King James,"" the ""New King James,"" the ""Jerusalem,"" the ""English Standard Version,"" and the ""Holman Christian Standard."" I do NOT like the NIV or the NRSV. Onto the subject at hand. The NASB is widely praised as the most literally accurate version. It does not contain the Apocrypha. But being that this is a Protestant Bible, we can't really hold that against it. The NASB is widely accepted in Protestant churches. For the most part, it is carefully literal. I consider it an interesting cross between the ""Revised Standard"" and the ""New King James."" My one slight complaint is that it is not quite as beautifully written as the ""Revised Standard."" But that said, the ""New American Standard"" is excellent.

"Propaganda: As a Psychologist specializing in the field of sexual health, I am utterly shocked and dismayed at this book. For those suffering from sexual addiction or for their partners who are looking for some peace, please do not invest in this propaganda. This book is not based on the science of either psychology or sexual health and is nothing more than the worst aspect of religious dogma and will ultimately result in further suffering. This type of hate mongering, intolerant, uneducated mindset is what has led to many of history's most devastating atrocities, done in the name of ""God."" A basic ethic of psychology and counseling is that that counselor or professional does not impose his or her own values upon their patients. Shame on you for writing such a book and calling yourself a counselor. You are an embarrassment to those of us who have dedicated our lives to trying to relieve human suffering.

"Great deal on a fine subwoofer: I recently replaced my 14 year old Velodyne FSR-12 with the DD-15. I did so because the FSR-12 was struggling in our new house with larger great room, and because the DD-15 was on sale due to its being replaced soon by the DD-15 Plus (at considerably higher price).The DD-15 is cruising in our new house. It really provides the bottom end that my Klipsch Heresies cannot. And it does not run out of steam at high volume, like the FSR-12 did.I am mainly a music guy, not so much into home theatre. The DD-15 brings music to life and makes the singers and instruments seem to be in the room with you. Everything you need is included, and the calibration software is a snap to use. The cabinetry is first rate. I got the cherry finish, and although I can't tell if it is really cherry; I would not bet money against it. It looks that good.I am quite pleased with Velodyne as a company, and I love my DD-15.

"why?: This is a terrific recording. Rob Brown is simply one of the most interesting alto saxophonists playing today. A keening, strident tone with an attack that is relentless; he takes his time building momentum and surprises with twists and turns but never loses his footing. When you play this recording it is difficult to do anything else but listen; it is that captivating.Lou Grassi and Wilbur Morris don't just sit in the back seat for this ride. They compliment the leader and provide idiomatic support all the way through.It is an amazing ride and one that I will continue returning to. Rob Brown is one of a small handful of players who always provides the goods. All of his efforts are worth investigating. If you can find this one, it's a real jewel.

When we found that it is virtually impossible to get a copy of the movie (it never came out on DVD and I no longer own a VHS player), I explored the option of reading the book. I was intrigued when I realized that the book was written in the 60's - a bit of a cultural leap from the 70's, when the movie was produced - so I decided to give it a read. Although I didn't grow up in the priveleged classes of Manhattan, I was a teenager throughout the 60's and I could relate to the times. It seemed a little milder in some respects from what I remember of the movie (and my memory is not the greatest), but it was a thoroughly enjoyable read.

She's not perfect. She has some flaws, like when she thinks her problem with her uncle is worse then when her friend's mother is arrested and may be put to death.

"Legend or the truth?: The Hound of the Baskervilles is a true mystery classic by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It tells of Sherlock Holmes and his trusty comrade, Dr. John Watson. This extraordinary pair has solved dozens of mysteries times before, but now come to their most difficult case. Years ago, Hugo Baskerville was killed by a monstrous hound. This curse of the hound has haunted all the Baskervilles who come to live at the Baskerville Hall. Sir Charles goes to live there, but soon is found dead, scared to death. His only relative, Sir Henry Baskerville, goes to live at Baskerville Hall accompanied by Holmes and Watson. All along the way, they are left mysterious clues that eventually help them unlock the killer. I really liked this classic who-dun-it because around every corner was a twist. It kept you guessing until the end and was really upbeat.

"Best Unknown Artist: What a great voice and masterful delivery of material. Someone else wrote sexy with a capitol S but that is insufficient. I'm not a big jazz fan and I guess this is not classic jazz but some sub-genre that really turns me on. Somehow the instrumentation, which is good, fades into the backround because Christy's voice is so present and distinctive. I can't tell you how many times I've played this cd and chosen it over my favorite classic rock. Its a great album to enjoy when you're happy just being by yourself and also a very nice listen when you're with someone special. I'm so glad I found some other music by her and I surely hope there is more comming. By the way, it has a couple of cuts that don't feature her and they are interesting and don't detract from the album.

"The single creepiest film of the year !!!: At the risk of repeating what all the other reviewers have stated, let me just say that this was as finely crafted a scarfest since the first Alien film. Writer/Director Neil Marshall is to be commended for creating a first rate horror film that, for once, doesn't rely on all the hacneyed tricks and CGI effects that have come down the pike in the last several years as well as utilizing cast of unknowns who also can't act to save their lives. This cast of unknowns are all good actors and handle their roles admirably. The score by David Julyan is the perfect accompaniment to Marshall's film and the cinematography and editing by Sam McCurdy and Jon Harris respectively combine to make this the true jewel of horror films.I normally don't purchase films of this ilk but after renting the film and getting the bejesus scared out of me I just had to own a copy. I would therefore recommend this film to anyone who enjoy their shocks and frights at high octane levels.

"harassing bears?: Cole is in the news for all the wrong reasons: ""Photographer, bear advocate cited for getting too close to bruins,"" by Scott McMillion, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, 3/25/05. Cole has been cited for harassing bear in Yellowstone National Park. He hasn't had his day in court yet, but you've got to wonder. It's easy to get close-up photos of grizzly/brown bears at designated (and well-managed) bear viewing areas in Alaska and Canada. To get publishable photos of grizzly bears in Yellowstone or Glacier, you've got to get so close you put yourself in danger and run the risk of driving the bears away from food they need or a place they want to be. Grizzlies are a threatened species in the lower 48 states. Why bother them when you can get photographs of grizzlies in Alaska without stressing the bears? What kind of bear advocate would do that?

"THE best book for AP spanish!: This book is the absolute best buy for AP Spanish Language preparation. It goes through every aspect of the test and has a very thorough review of all grammar tested in the exam (although I thought that they had a little more then what was needed). The practice tests accurately measure with the difficulty and format of the real test. Having a bad situation with an inexperienced teacher, I picked up this book and used it for self-study. It helped me greatly, and in the end, I received a 4 just by going through it myself and practicing.

"great lil printer, BUT: I bought this to replace my original HP 4L Laser jet after 15 years. This seems to do a great job so far, much faster downloads and clean print,BUT BEWARE.... IT DOES NOT COME WITH A USB CORD TO CONNECT, so if the printer your replacing has the old stle connecter (as mine did) be ready to spend another $35.00 for a usb cord. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.

"good printer: I have bought this printer for my personal use at home.It is good and reliable printer for the price.Somehow, it arrived with software instalation CD in a forein language which was a big inconvenience.The white color chose by manufacturer is a questionable. It is a white spot in a room and I bet for many households it can be a problem.Also, lack of any controls buttons is inconvenient to restart a job even after paper reload.

"Great printer, unless you're using Vista: I like this printer a lot and would probably have given it 5 stars, but it gets a major demerit thanks to the fact that it does not work with computers running Vista. HP will not be releasing the drivers until July of this year. So if you want to print now and not wait six months, and you've already upgraded to Vista, I recommend getting a different printer. Hopefully HP will get the message and release some drivers. Vista has been in beta for a long time, so I find this delay to be inexcusable.

"Great Read - Suspenseful: When I first started reading the book I kept putting it down, it just wasn't grabbing my attention, but once I got further into the book my curiosity got the best of me. I couldn't put the book down. I could not believe that a woman would do the things that she did. Adrian Jenkins was confused and deceitful. All hell does break loose. Gregory's relationship with his mother was sad. I understand her point for leaving but at the same time it was selfish. It not only destroyed Gregory but it also destroyed his little sister. I am definately looking forward to her next book.

"Design flaw prevents easy installation: For a 1/2"" slip-mount installation, this diverter spout is not worth the trouble.You must unscrew the diverter's plastic nipple, remove a plastic adapter, slide it on the copper pipe, screw the plastic nipple back on, tighten the screw so as to punch a hole in the plastic, slide the plastic nipple back toward the wall, tighten the screw, and then screw the spout on after applying thread tape. That seems straightforward, but in practice it's very difficult.The problem is that the plastic nipple is too small to fit 1/2"" copper pipes longer than about 1"" from the wall. The instructions say that the pipe can be up to 2-3/4"" long, but actually this is wrong. At first I struggled with trying to install it, then broke the plastic when I could not force it to go all the way in.I elected instead to go withMoen 3808BN Kingsley Slip Fit Tub Diverter Spout, Brushed Nickel, which simply slips in and then tightens with a screw, with almost no effort.

It provides the most detailed history of Westmoreland Glass that I have ever seen, and some of the facts are fascinating. However, it is very, very, very poorly organized. Photos are not always identified. Many items are discussed but not depicted in photo or sketch. The price guide in the back uses different names/descriptions than what is used in the text of the book, so you can never be sure if you are checking value on the correct item. I enjoyed the book, but if you want to learn more about various pieces of Westmoreland glass, you will need to buy other books. Unfortunately, I cannot offer advice on what others because I have not found a good one yet. Lorainne Kovar's books are GROSSLY OVERPRICED and still do not do the job they should.

"mesmerizing marlene: If anyone else but Marlene Dietrich had played the lead in this film, the film would have been awful! Dietrich triumphs in a role no-one would have predicted. mysterious, mesmerizing, seductive, funny, and finally moving as the loyal gypsy(!) Lyddia, Dietrich makes you overlook the films flaws. At times the film drags by, some supporting players seem to have cotton in their mouths as they speak, and some of the dialogue is inane. Through it all, Dietrich is the soul of this movie, holding it all together in spite of the flaws, to make the whole thing work. Worth watching as a romantic piece of Hollywood escapism, and for seeing Dietrich as the fine actress she is.

"Quality dropped in the last 6 months: I have 4 boys and have always alternated (for price) between Pampers and Huggies. Both diapers have gone downhill in the last 6 months. They have less absorbency, the top of the diaper in the front constantly explodes and overnight is out of the option. The strip is not as wide to catch urine, it's been cut down. Constantly waking up with both my twins soaking wet, the diaper has exploded and the more generic absorbing material sticks to everything. We've had to change out the sheets, clothes and anything else everyday. Several times, the diapers have ripped apart so bad, they needed immediate baths from all the gel coming out. I've grown more concerned, that since it's coming out so bad, it's coming out of the buttons of their clothes and them eating it. Is this a ploy to get people into buying the almost 3 times more expensive overnights? I don't know, but they certainly aren't what they have been for the last 8 years.

I feel that Huggies run really small. They are also so soft I feel confident using them on my babies sensitive skin. I will use these again with my next baby.

"the best but only this time: pampers makes the best diapers with the most varieties for your needs. however their collect points promotion is misleading. by the time you save up any worthwhile points your child will have outgrown the selection. also the shipping and handling fees out weigh the cost at any store. dishonest and mean spirited. next child will use lesser quality diapers but from a company with more integrity.

"Swaddlers are better, but...: I wish Swaddlers went up to my son's size. He is 4 months old and already weighs 24 lbs. These are good, but Swaddlers in bigger sizes would be ideal. I have not yet tried the cruisers, but based on ratings, these seem to be what most prefer. I have not had any problems with these, excet my son outgrows them so fast! Each shipment I order, it seems I have to go up a size. Love Pampers products.

"Keeps baby dry and no diaper rash!: I've tried many diapers over the years and I've found that Pampers are the best. They fit well, provide the right amount of ventilation so our babies don't get a rash and they hold a lot of liquid. My only complaint is the price. They are so darn expensive!

"Fall Apart: I love Pampers Swaddlers so I thought I'd try these once my baby outgrew the Swaddlers. While I've never had any issues with leaking, I've had to throw out at least four brand-new diapers (so far) because the the entire side where the tab tears off while I'm trying to fasten the diaper. I've never had this problem with Swaddlers or Huggies, so I know it's not the operator. Also, these diapers don't seem to fit very securely. They tend to sag and feel very cheap (even my husband commented on that and he generally doesn't notice these kinds of things). I've only used about 20 diapers from my box of 140, but I'm sure I'll have more problems with tearing. What a waste!

"Leaky and expensive: These diapers are too expensive and leaky than other diapers. Usually i don't buy them because of high cost but I bought them for the first time thinking that they will be gud but they were the oppsosite. They leak if you forget to change a diaper before the baby sleeps. I usually use LUVS DIAPERS. They are far betther than these and cheaper as well. I made a great mistake thinking that if it is expensive it will be good.People don't waste your money in this junk product.

"horrible diapers ever: Pampers Baby Dry Size 2 Diapers Economy Pack Plus 246 CountI'VE MADE A HUGE MISTAKE BUYING THESE DIAPERS. I thought it is a good deal and i can save some money. but when i received these pampers baby dry diapers i opened the box and i find out that all of them has a little tiny brown stain on the back. since it was the first time i got these diapers i guessed it shoud've been this way so i put one on my 1 month and half baby girl. when it comes to change her diaper i was really shocked. her butt and all the diaper area was in terrible red color and she had the worst rash so far. i put several pastes and cream to treat it. it took almost 2 day to get rid of them finally. she had been using this particular diaper like for 2 hours and for this little time it caused this terrible reaction. i dont understand how can people sell such a product especially baby stuff has to be carefully examined. do not repeat my mistake. NEVER BUY these diapers !!!

"Pampers Baby Dry - not recommended: I purchased these baby dry thinking we could step up from the Pampers Swaddlers. I was wrong. I just assumed they would be as good as the swaddlers but they are not. My baby girl is 6 months and is an average baby...not chunky or big (other reviews mentioned it may have an impact on the diaper)Here are my con's:-do not absorb like I need them to. She is up one to two times per night and if I don't change her at one of the feedings by morning she will be in a puddle and I will have to wash everything.-they are not nearly as soft as swaddlers.- when she is really wet the inside of the diaper will come apart and stick to her..it is a stringy something that sticks to her legs.yuck.They really are fine during the day, it is at nap and night time that she seems to over flow out of the diaper. I will not order another box of these. I was honestly shocked that they were not better because I really love pampers. Oh well. live and learn.

"Best diapers for us: I haven't really strayed from Pampers since my son was born - each time we borrowed a diaper from a friend or went on vacation and had to use another brand, they didn't work as well (tabs not restickable, not as absorbent, etc) and we went back to Pampers. I discovered Baby Dry because we were in Mexico and that was the type of Pampers they had in the Costco there - baby dry is great - they are thin and super absorbent. Amazon is the best place to buy them - especially if you use subscribe and save.

"Best Diapers at a great price: I've looked at quite a few different places to get a good price on diapers, and Amazon has been the best (same price as my local stores, but they get delivered right to my door, free shipping) I calcuate the price per diaper, and Amazon is always the cheaper, or equal to other sites/local stores.As for the diaper itself, I love pampers brand (for diapers, not wipes) over any other diaper brand. I prefer the ""baby dry"" over the cruisers (for price and quality) and now that they make the baby dry with the ""caterpillar stretch"" sides, they're even better! They fit like a dream, even on my skinny little boy!!!

"Terrible Smell and Horrible Rash: We've been getting Pampers Baby Dry from a Wholesale club for a while now, with no problems (my son is 13 months, in size 4). I saw the price on Amazon and with the 30% off, it was a great deal. However, when the box arrived the diapers smelled AWFUL -- chemical-like. I gave them a day to air out, which they did, but in the next few days of using them my son has developed a terrible diaper rash. He has only had tiny rashes 3-4 times in the past, but this one is continuous and awful-looking. We are discontinuing use of these particular ones immediately, and going back to the Wholesale club. I don't think it's Baby Dry, per se, but the shipment that Amazon has. It really upsets me that they would offer inferior diapers at such a reduced price -- they need to be tossed and NEVER touch a baby's skin.

"hyped!: Walt Whitman's literary reputation has been hyped by ""gay"" critics (I suspect). I'm not totally hostile to free verse; in fact, I like T.S.

"Power Off Solution?: I've had my 940MW for over a year. When 1st received, after turning on, it would work for 5 to 10 minutes and then cut off. I tried removing and re-pluging in the power cord and it would work for a few minutes and then the monitor would again cut off. Then I tried a different approach. I removed the power cord and squeezed the end that goes to the monitor with regular pliars. SINCE THEN, THE MONITOR HAS NOT 'TURNED ITSELF OFF' ONCE!I believe that what was happening, in my case anyway, was the power cord connection at the monitor would heat up and expand and break the flow of AC. Squeezing the power cord with the pliars 'tightened up' the connection allowing the cord to maintain contact. I looked at the monitors plug hole after removing the power cord, and the connection lugs were inset into the monitor farther that I think they should be. I think that that caused the problem.Don't know if this helps anyone else.That is the only reason I don't give this monitor a 5 rating.

"What kind of person could have done this...: Great book for anyone interested in true crime and the criminal mind. John Douglas looks at some classic crime cases using his profiling method: look at the facts of the crime and draw conclusions about what kind of person could have done it. This is in contrast to the approach of: identify a likely suspect, then identify facts of the crime that fit the suspect. The author does not claim to solve all of the cases he studies in this book, but rather point us in the right direction. For example, he describes the likely personality characteristics and behavior of Jack the Ripper (interestingly this does not seem to match Patricia Cornwell's conclusion) and the Zodiac. His discussion of the Ramsey case is probably the most controversial since he was personally involved in the case. A well written and interesting book.

He primarily spends a great deal of time on two key areas: context of area in which crime committed and victomology.From Jack the Ripper to JonBenet Ramsey, he applies all that years of working the toughest cases has brought to him.One that fascinated me the most was the one I knew the least, the Lindbergh kidnapping. The missing chisel, the removed flooring, all this pointing to the convicted one. Also, that Gen. Schwartzkopf's relative was involved.These cases do hold our yearning to solve mystery, especially that where justice is sought and all can see if their hunches play out.

"easy to understand guide: When my 6 year old niece was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, my family was devastated. Her parents are both RNs, and so could more easily understand a lot of the terminology and treatments. I have absolutely no medical background, and I found this book to be very helpful. This book provided comprehensive explanations of various treatments, commonly used drugs, different types of brain and spinal cord tumors, etc. that were easy for a layperson to understand. I also really liked that there were many shared experiences from other families who had dealt with childhood cancer, it made me feel like we weren't alone.

"There's a reason this was only on TV: The original Patton motion picture is a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies. George C. Scott is a genius and one of my favorite actors. I was happy to find this movie on Amazon on Demand, but was disappointed with the movie itself.-Looks like a low-budget made for TV movie which it is.-Casting was poor. Outside of George C. Scott these were a bunch of B or C actors. Richard Dysart as Eisenhower was particularly bad.-As noted in many other reviews, the video quality was poor.-Way too long and way too depressing.I was hoping this movie would cover more of the postwar Patton and less of George C. Scott lying in a hospital bed. If they cut off the last third of the movie, it might be four stars.I recommend you pass on this movie, at the very least stop watching after the accident. He suffers paralyzed in a hospital bed and dies. There is nothing useful after that point and there is a LOT of overacting.

"Ian Richardson version of The Hound of the Baskervilles: I highly recommend this 1983 version of the Sherlock Holmes mystery. Richardson suits the role of Holmes very well, bringing a confidence and intellectual flare to solving the case.I can't be critical of much in this movie. I enjoyed it immensely on vhs and now, again, on dvd. It's well acted, well scripted, and well produced. I think Ian Richardson is my favourite Sherlock Holmes - although I don't think he played the role as many times as other actors. Again, he brings such confidence in his ability, that as a viewer you don't really think he's not going to solve the mystery.Thumbs up. Enjoy.

At that time, in gratitude, I humbly asked to be given the means and privilege to make others happy through music.""A LOVE SUPREME was recorded in 1964 after the death of his friend, Eric Dolphy, and the birth of his 1st son. These events must have inspired Coltrane to create his masterpiece. Outside of Bach's B Minor Mass, I can't think of a greater work of pure spirituality in music. Whether or not you are into Jazz, you should listen to A LOVE SUPREME at least once in your life.

"Silicone Case for Palm Treo 755p: I am enjoying its use. The only issue is one of manufacturing. The opening that allows for moving of the vibrate off/on control does not align with the control. It is difficult to move the control. I modified the case by making a small cut to it.

"Great 80's Concept Album !: It's moody, a little dark, like for driving down the highway at night . . . But that's why I loved it in the 1980's ! I just was never able to find the CD ! To me, it is the most well-done, well-produced album by Tommy Shaw, as I have heard most of his others to date . . . Still, yes, it has a certain heavy keyboard-80's sound, but it is more 'serious' than his other efforts in my humble opinion . . .So, dark, but GREAT guitar, it should have really been the concept for another Styx album, instead of the more light-wieght stuff they all have done . . .

"One of the most disturbing ""war movies"" ever made.: Unfairly ignored during it's initial release this movie deserves another chance.Unlike most war movies this film concentrates not on battles but the heinous acts of some soldiers as they kidnap a girl rape and abuse her.Michael J. Fox plays the one soldier who tries to stand up and do the right thing.Fox proves he's got what it takes to hold his own in a serious part(even better than Bright Lights Big City)and Sean Penn is riveting as the soldier who takes things too far.I saw this in theaters in 1989 and it left me shaken and surprisingly years later it still hasn't lost it's impact.Director Brian DePalma who usually makes stylish gimmick loaded films does a great job here with the serious subject matter.The haunting score by Ennio Morricone that accompanies the poor girl's ordeal will stay in your mind for a very long time.Tough to watch but extremely worthwhile if you're looking for powerful cinema.

"Swimming against the tide, but...: An improvisation is wonderful, if, and this is a huge if, an improvement on the original is made. After listening to all 15 cuts I have to say that in every case the original is more enjoyable and satisfying to me to listen to. Can you really expect Montero to improve on Vivaldi? That really is too much. However if it is not as enjoyable as the Vivaldi, why would I spend money to listen to Montero? This revue is in no way a reflection on her pianistic abilities, but it sure is a gripe about butchering classic source material.My advice, and it seems to be unique among reviewers so far, is that if you like Vivaldi, listen to Vivaldi, not Montero seeking to change Vivaldi. Or Bach. Or Scarlatti. Or Pachebel...The original is stunning...the alterations to it are just misc. music.

"Absurd Plot: The author is quite talented; the book well written. The religious history very interesting. There is sufficient adventure, intrigue and excitement.But the central theme, that many core beliefs of Catholicism are at odds with the God it purports to serve, that Mary herself has repudiated such beliefs, and that a progressive pope will shortly put an end to these beliefs, is more than a stretch, it devolves into an anti-Catholic message that is wrapped around a good yarn. This is exacerbated by the depiction of high church officials as evil Mafia type figures who readily engage in heinous acts, including murder and extortion. Yes, some church officials have in the past been guilty of deceit and cover ups to protect child abusers, but this is a far cry from high church officials engaging in conduct rivaling that of the characters in ""The Godfather"" series. But if comparing the Catholic church to the evil demonstrated in those movies is your cup to tea, then this book is for you.

"A fine read: Steve Berry is one of those writers you love to read - from the get-go you are part of the ride. Each one of his works is a given that it will entertain, and get you thinking.Secret deals with the message the Holy Virgin gave to the children at Fatima -Has some of the grace of Angels and Demons, but not the wild ride of an ending, although a satisfactory one.Definitely worth reading.
",0,0
"Better than The Templar Legacy or The Amber Room: Although Berry's bad guys are pretty unconflicted about being bad guys (especially for priests) and the reveal regarding the third secret of Fatima is jarring more for its anachronistic feel than for its content, this yarn is similar to Dan Brown's Angels and Demons in its look at the inner workings of papal enclaves and backstage Vatican politicking. It starts just a bit slow, but has a satisfying build-up of suspense and twists so as to make it a reasonable page-turner for those who won't get too hung up on the undertone of criticism for the current Catholic church and its various doctrines. While there are some odd character choices and a bit of inconsitency about how urgent various things are and aren't along the way, I found myself entertained and turning pages and, after all, isn't that really the point of a mass market thriller?

It is the kind of novel that I find perfect to relax at the end of the day or on vacation.

But the rest of the 2 hours is made up of 2 confused people trying to come to terms with their histories which are related to the horror story portion by analogy (and the man's brief contact with the dead children). There was supposed to be a psychological reason behind the horror -- but it didn't strike me as particularly insightful. Instead it was dreary. The acting, even by Jun Ji Hyun, was dreary.

No matter what setting I put it on, the temperature remained at a constant 42 degrees which is too cold for storing red or white wine. Amazon made the return easy. They sent UPS to my house to pick up the item. I was very discouraged about the idea of ordering again. I finally ordered a Magic Chef wine cellar through Home Depot. It arrived well packed and seems to be working just fine.

"A woman's transformation/ a professor's redemption: ""Educating Rita"" can be enjoyed at many levels of understanding. It can simply bring pleasure and good feelings. And it can be understood as a story of love that is harnessed for the growth of each person involved in the mentoring relationship. For a woman who has to take her own journey, it is validating. For a stale and jaded teacher, it is instructive. For any love relationship that develops between student and teacher, it shows - in the very best light - what can happen to each when they recognize the true purpose of their exciting and marvelous luck in being brought into each others lives. That luck is: nothing short of the transformation of both of them.It is my wish that life could be lived more often at this level, with passion, determination, humour, guts and grace.

"Outstanding: Marriott was the man, and deserves to be remembered, but the fact that he was one of the best R&B vocalists this country's ever produced means anyone trying to do his songs justice is probably, with all the best intentions, going to struggle. Steve Ellis comes closest to hitting the notes, the best of his tracks being Song Of A Baker. Dennis Greaves, Simon ""Honeyboy"" Hickling, and Midge Ure all perform well. Both the tracks by Deborah Bonham are outstanding, in particular (If You Think You're) Groovy, which is easily the best thing on the album. The tracks by Weller/Gallagher/McLagen et al are good, but you'd expect better. As for Tony Rivers ripping the throat out of Itchycoo Park, the less said about it the better.Review in brief: Good Tracks - 18 out of 21. Best Track: (If You Think You're) Groovy, Deborah Bonham. Worst Track: Itchycoo Park, Tony Rivers. Worth buying? Yes, because the good tracks make up for the bad ones.

"ATTENTION HISTORY LOVERS: For all of you that like English History with a twist of mystery than you will love the novella, THE DAUGHTER OF TIME by Josephine Tey. This is a mystery novel that deals a lot with English History and Old Kings and stuff, whic is something that I just don't mesh with. On a scale of one to ten I would have to rate this book a three. The reading was a bit hard, and I often found myself counting the pages until I was finished. Though I usually love mystery, this one was definitely a disappointment on countless levels. The book was written well and I think that if I had been a tad bit older and wiser on English History that I may have enjoyed it more. Overall I think that I would personally have to give the book two thumbs down.

So when my book club asked me to recommend a mystery, this was an easy choice (backed up by it's ranking as one of Amazon's best mysteries of the Century). Well, they hated it. Why bother solving a centuries old mystery? So I offer this experience to say that this is a terrific book if you like mysteries or English history. Others may not care for it.

"Hooked on the Brothers!: Super Mario Bros. is a video game movie that is memorable in the way that may surprise you. The witty dialogue and rapport between Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as Mario and Luigi, respectively, make this film a real treat upon repeated viewings. Although it features a look that may remind people more of Blade Runner than Super Mario Bros., it has the same charm in its set design that other 1990s science-fiction films have, such as Total Recall or Demolition Man. The tone shifts all over the place from light and comedic to dark and frightening, but the sheer inventiveness on display here make Super Mario Bros. worth a watch. Dennis Hopper gives a performance straight out of a David Lynch film in this one. Watch this flick and I guarantee you'll be hooked on the brothers!

"flawed concept: Here's my problem: While I do think we create a lot of our own problems in this life, I don't think every single situation in life is one of our own creation. To me, saying that we create everything in our lives through our ""thought vibrations"" is saying that people in the world who are suffering are just not thinking correctly. Our experiences come to us because of our thoughts and beliefs? Really? So, for example, the Jews killed during the Holocaust were just not sending out enough positive energy? Granted, what the author is really talking about is MUCH smaller situations in our everyday lives, ones we can control. But still, this blanket statement about the power of thought really bothered me. Also, I was looking for more concrete ""how to"" information, which I found a bit lacking in this book. I know the author was going for simplicity, but I found the illustrations and exercises a bit too simplistic and not terribly helpful.

When reading the narrative of the canniblaism I was just about to shout, enough! when he stopped. The book flowed well and was never boring. The explanations of whaling and the culture, both in Nantucket and on ship, were well done. The sadness of wrong decisions and how they can have such a devestating affect on others is something many of us can relate to as we make decisions throughout life. I appreciated the Epilogue, but felt the extensiveness of the Notes were unnecessary. It was already evident that much research had gone into this book. This book is certainly not for everyone. those who are looking for a love story will not find it here.

The ship Essex was sunk by a whale and that was the inspiration for writing Moby Dick. It is most interesting reading about the survival of a few and how they eventually made it back to land.

"Riveting Story of Survival (and Death) at Sea: This is one of my favorite books of all time. The shocking sinking of the Essex (the inspiration for Moby Dick) is only the beginning of what the author turns into a gut-wrenching tale of a handful of sailors desperately trying to stave off starvation, thirst and madness as they try to make it from the middle of the Pacific back to South America.

"Inside the Whalers: Philbrick takes the reader on a journey like no other, and explains each wave along the way. I couldn't put it down. I had a special interest in that my great-great-grandfather was a whaling captain (""Master""), and traveled those waters with my great-grandfather as a toddler on board. My one criticism of the author's perspective is what he didn't critique - cannibalism! I know it is easy to point fingers when I was not there, starving and dying of thirst, but the author went too far in the other direction and became their justifiers, based on the accounts of two survivors who chose to eat their friends. Why was there not a serious discussion about chosing to die with dignity rather than deify life at the cost of eating and drinking your friends? Perhaps the men who died earlier did hold to this. Why was that not a significant part of this work?Nevertheless, thank you Nate Philbrick for a book that should be made into a movie, with some of this balance.

"An Exciting Tale of Survival: The sinking of the Essex by a whale is probably most famous as the inspiration for Herman Melville's Moby Dick but in In the Heart of the Sea (The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex) by Nathaniel Philbrick, the reader will be engaged in an adventure more exciting than most works of fiction. The author skillfully combines elements from the accounts of two survivors to locate the truth of the tale. In addition, one will become immeresed in the history of Nantucket, the whaling industry (including graphic accounts of the hunt not for the faint hearted), and other elements of this particular place and time in history. An exciting read and a fine speciman of that popular creature, the true survival story. Highly recommended.

"not too compatible with iMac: the set-up requirement for the Tivo wireless connector to my Apple wireless network would require me to change the setup of all the other components on my network.

"wasted my money: I spent an entire afternoon trying to get this piece of junk to talk to my wireless network. Went through the steps a bazillion times . It found my network and could not get an IP address ( after WEP key entered). Customer service were on the phone with me for hours and I think it safe to say we tried everything. Their final suggestion was call your ISP (Comcast) who were unable to help.So - I bought a new Tivo specifically to use on my network so I could broadcast my MP3 collection through my AV system and cant. Add to the fact thatthe new Tivo is giving problems switching channels and you can see what a giant step backwards I took - If I could give this zero stars I would!

"I like Hardy, but I loved the Mayor: I like this story the most of Hardy's works. An interesting tale with some good, realistic characters. I think I'll read it again.
",0,0
"I liked this book.: At first, I was a little confused as to how Hardy could stretch what seemed to be a simple plot into such a long novel--especially because the story in blurb on the back cover happened within the first 50 pages. But the story is more than the blurb on the back cover. It is about betrayal, last wishes, the ""evils"" of drink, and how one mistake can affect you 21 years down the road. Hardy's fatalistic view, seen through Henchard, is, at times, enough to drive the reader crazy.Like many of the other reviewers here, I cried throughout the book. There are constant turns in the story line that at times uplift your soul, and then crash it into the depths of depression. This book is not an easy read though. There are sections that you will struggle to get through because it is dry, but then there are others that will keep you up at night rushing to finish.I liked this book slightly less than I liked _Tess_, but it was _Tess_ that made me buy this book. Enjoy!

"Hard questions....Real Answers: This book asks some hard questions in the way it scrutinizes the bible. Reverend Teel then answers the questions in a way that makes sense and gives a real understanding of the possibilities. The book asks the reader to set aside all preconceived notions on religion, Jesus, and God and take a look at it in a most unique way. I went into the book on the defensive as a fundamentalist Christian and found myself following the argument of Reverend Teel and even, at moments, agreeing with him. While I certainly don't agree with all of the points he brings out, he does bring up some really good questions and gives some really provocative and thought provoking answers. He asks the reader only to keep an open mind and in the end I was moved by the book, I'm recommending it to all of my friends.

"Snooz-a-pa-looza: Total waste of celluloid, not to mention time, money etc. Not entertaining at all. Not creative at all. Not artistic in the least. Absolutely nothing happens in this ill attempt at making something provocative. The viewer gets to accompany someone, who resembles Cobain, for an uneventful, boring walk in the woods and a mission to avoid any contact with anyone else. The only thing that kept me from ejecting the DVD was my faith in ole Gus. I kept saying to myself,"" this can't be all there is to this film.""

I really cant understand why we cant just leave him alone!! Hes a great artist with a great band! The legend should be left to rest in peace!! Kurt's probably turning in his grave over this.

"What a waste!: Unfortunately this is supposed to be inspiration for the last days of Kurt Cobains life. Leave it to this jackass who sold out to everything Kurt Cobain wasn't. Let alone this story was told from someone whom never met the man. Merely this movie was from someone who watched ""The Doors"" too many times. What a waste, another person selling out to the all mighty dollar trying to make his film career. I'd recommend buying any album from Nirvana if you want to know the true singer in the shadows.

"Dissapointed...: I caught this movie a while ago while it was playing still playing at the theater. I was very saddened by how dissapointing it turned out to be. I'm sorry, Michael Pitt is the wrong choice to play Kurt Cobain (even if this is just inspired after the famous late musician). The trouble is, I don't think anyone could really play Kurt. I suppose there are people in this movie (Kim Gordan of Sonic Youth and the director Gus Van Sant) who actually knew Kurt while he was alive, so they know something I don't obviously. Regardless of the mis-casting, in my opinion, the film is terribly slow and ultimately kind of pointless. We already know how it's going to end (like with ""Elephant"") but the same director asks that he keep our attention spans going till the end to satisfy his obsession with these real life tragic outcomes. I admire Van Sant's lofty goal to create a piece of cinema to attribute to my hero Kurt, but it just falls short in the end.

"Difficult Read: This story is one of the most difficult stories I have read thus far. I am supposed to summarize the story for an English Majors course; but because the sentences are so long and tangled, I keep losing track of which character is being talked about.

"An Insult to the English Language: I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust.

"Don't waste your money - buy 3rd edition used.: The back cover states ""Thoroughly updated for it's Fourth Edition"". Not true. The only difference between this and the 3rd edition is that the three Clinical Problem sets at the back of the 3rd edition (pages 347-383) have been replaced by a set of additional questions called the Maintenance of Certification Primer (pages 345-375). In the first 345 pages there may be a few questions that have changed between the 2 editions but I haven't found one yet - even chapter 7, the Pictorial Atlas, is unchanged. And I suspect the same will be true for the 4 online practice exams. Bottom line - buy the 3rd edition used for about $2 and save yourself $60. Still, this book is ok for FP boards as is Swanson's.

In short, if you are a fan of Bond, you will want this, but don't expect too much from it.

"Solid overall: Helmut Rilling does well with large scale works of Bach, which is a plus on the B Minor Mass. Everything is well articulated, with solid bass lines (often lacking in ""authentic"" performances). He captures the faith aspect very well. His ""crucifixus"" is the best I have heard in capturing the pain of the cross, followed by the brilliant contrast of ""et resurrexit"". He has an excellent cast of soloists. It flows well, but has a very slight feel of heavy-footedness. It has none of the dance quality so prominent in the Mauersberger recording (Rudolf Mauersberger one of few who can bring out both dance and devotion). Overall, most people who are not too much into ""Historically Informed"" would find this quite satisfying.

"This seems like an excuse to get Hester back on the battlefield.: Not one of the stronger entries in the series, SLAVES OF OBSESSION suffers from too many set pieces and not enough of the emotional complexity usually found in this series. Far too much time is spent on the philosophical battle between Union and Confederate issues; battles better detailed in many other works, and not enough on developing a strong narrative. The trip to America for Monk and Hester to recapture an American and his runaway English teen on a charge of murder is relatively ridiculous and only serves as an opportunity for Perry to showcase Hester's nursing ability. It's an interesting scene, but really just fills pages and does not move the narrative forward. Even the mystery's solution resolution left me less than satisfied, a perfunctory ending to a pedestrian entry in the series.

"A Lesson in Human Tragedy: This piece is ultimate Steinbeck. The author has limited his characters to two major ones and a few ancillary ones. The book is short, however, the tale is told thoroughly. The reader feels so very sorry for George. George is a study of loyalty, decency and patience and how one feels so utterly responsible for the life of another human being-in this case his childhood friend, Lennie, who is somewhat mentally challenged. This book is a sad account of the fragility of human beings and how one person will be loyal to the other person til the end-even if he needs to commit murder to show it. The character, Candy, is so very pathetic too and his comments about "" a stranger killing my old dog"" are so very sad! One tends to think that it was because of Candy feeling badly about a stranger killing his dog that George does what he does. This is a beautiful book!

"Of Mice and Men! More like Manly Mice!: I found several critical problems with this play, including narrative structure, plot thematics, metaphorical irony, and satirical narcissism. Serious scholars need not apply. The books are not for the people to do with Lenny and Carl.

"A Simple Story That Says So Much: Short, but marvelous. That's Of Mice and Men in three words, but that nutshell does extreme injustice to the true wonder of this classic.Through this tale, John Steinbeck was able to say so much, in so little words.

I will never forget Of Mice and Men, for it has found its own special place in my heart, and forever there it will remain.

"Lexi A.W., student of Maces Lane Middle School the best book I have ever read: Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was the best book I have ever read. The characters, the mentally retarded Lennie and the tough George, are on the run from people from Weed. Lennie was accused of trying to rape a girl in a red dress when he actually wanted to touch it since it was so soft. After that, they find a ranch in Salinas, California to work on for a while. There are conflicts and solutions all at the same time.My favorite character was Lennie because even though, he was really mentally retarded, he was kind and did nothing out of harm. He knew that George loved him by giving tough love while on the ranch. All he thought about was the rabbits. ""I get to tend the rabbits"" was my all time favorite quote because he always said it to remind himself what he was going to do when they got off the farm. Sometimes, I always thought he was rather hopeful even when he was sad.

Well while they both keep working on the fields Bucking Barley, they come up with an idea to own a house and a couple of acres.

"Great piece of american literature.: I was in 9th grade when i read this book for the first time and i was very impressed. In my opinion this book is one of the finest books ever written by an american author(Steinbeck). It takes place in the early 1900's where 2 friends find a job helping out on a farm. They meet several interesting people there and run in to some problems. Throughout this movie they are in search of what they refer to as the fat of the land or the american dream.

"don't read this book: When I started reading the book at school I found it boring. I had to read it for school (if I didn't read it I would had a 1) and almost all the class found it boring. It's funny when Leenie (principal characters who does stupid thing. George say's in one part to the owner of the ranch ""I'm not saying he's bright, he ain't, but he's as strong as a bull."") but the theme doesn't make it a pleasure to read. The book is easy to understand and doesn't have difficult words. The story is about to people, George and Leenie, who are itinerant workers who go to one place to another to find job. They have a dream but it's very difficult for them to make it true because of Leenie's dumbness. When they're working in ranch problems happens because of Leenie. The entire story is about that subject. To finish my review ill tell you not to spend your time reading this book when there are better books (unless you have to read it for school). I could only recommended to Steinbecks fans.

"Lukewarm at Best: I saw this in a little theatre in Manhattan, hoping for a more polished, Morrissey-rich experience, but this was a pretty sub-par affair- and frankly it's annoying to see a film this poor with even decent distribution. Terrible camerawork and spotty acting over-all. Bad editing and annoying Cali pop-punk soundtrack, only saved by the presence of Quasi. I was really disappointed- when people put such little effort and inspiration into something, and they get support, one less person with a real vision gets heard. It was occasionally worth a laugh, but overall I found myself angry at the Gods for opening up the Pandora's box of indie films without keeping the hacks out. We have enough of those in Hollywood.

I had already read a lot of books on sleep training, and while there were some really good tips here, I found 'The Contented Little Baby Book' by Gina Ford more direct. Weissbluth allows for more discretion which I think a mother needs, and overall I think this is a very good book to be read in conjunction with other philosophies, and you can adapt what works for your style and babies.

Sooner or later he's bound to fall for her too. The real challenge is for him to come up with new methods to make her remember.It turns out to be a charming, romantic and very touching movie. One of the BEST movies in this genre to come out in 2005!

"Schizophrenic product: At the core of the movie is an affecting concept: a man who falls in love with a woman who can't remember him the following morning. So each day he has to make her fall in love with him all over again. It's a touching situation and the two co-leads play this aspect of the movie with delicacy and charm. However this wasn't enough for the marketing & development people, so they added a ton of crude slap-stick and a lot of stale and offensive sexual ""humor."" This robs the movie of any chance it might have had to touch the viewer's heart, and left me wondering how the movie ever made it out of the cutting room. The earlier movie in which these two co-leads appeared, The Wedding Singer, was fortunate enough not to suffer from these drawbacks. 50 First Dates is a movie worth missing.

"The First Fifty Sandler Movies...: ... could be cut and re-edited in arbitrary sequences and nobody would notice. Sandler is the apotheosis of the one-trick pony, the actor who is always exactly the same character in every film. In short, he doesn't act at all; like Yahweh, he just 'is that he is.'Take a look at the expression on the face of Ms Barrymore in the picture on the DVD cover; that's exactly how I look when I find myself watching another Adam Sandler film. Unfortunately, my teenage son and my two twenty-something nieces all find Sandler rib-splitting funny. Being a companionate adult, therefore, I sit cross-legged among them and gape at the screen, forcing a chuckle now and then like a losing presidential candidate at a town meeting. Then sometimes I offer to run out for ice cream....

"alot like life - funny & tragic: I won't bore you with the plot of the movie as I assume you have an idea what it's about if you've come this far. I found the film stood up quite well as a romantic comedy. It was both delightfully funny and a bit sad at times (just like life). I am surprised that some of the reviewers have taken the film so seriously and are disturbed by how the critical events are portrayed. It's just a film and it's meant to entertain. It did a great job of that, with the terrific on-screen chemistry of Sandler (although I can't stand him in most other films) and Barrymore.

"Fall in Love for the First Time Everyday!: The idea behind this film is that in a successful relationship you have to fall in love over and over again. In this story it happens literally everyday.The performances:Adam Sandler as Henry Roth shows his vulnerable side in his best and most natural performance.Drew Barrymore as Lucy Whitmore has never been better, and has great chemistry with Adam. She emerges as a fine actor.Rob Schneider as Ula may fool you that he is really the character he is playing, I didn't know it was him for half the move! He is brilliantly funny.Sean Astin as Doug Whitmore (better known as Sam from the Lord of the Rings) is funny in this comic role as Lucy's lisping brother.Pomaika'i Brown as Nick (tattoo face) the cook, is great in his small role and deserves bigger roles in the future.Shot in Hawaii, it has beautiful cinematography and vibrant color. The movie is a combination of humor and romance with more heart than you might expect.

"so did you read the DNA report?: it appears that except Indologist everybody else know how to read mtDNA findings. nowhere in the book I could read the recent breakthrough about the lack of genetic evidence on Aryan invasion and migration. and after concluding that Indus valley had the evidence of fire place, shiva and shakti seals and so on, she then again go back to the imaginary of how European white Aryan descended to the black Dravidian world of Indus valley. if that is how Westerner try to write history of other cultures, I myself being a westerner feel very sorry for my own people. The bottom line is this: do not try to defend something that is indefensible. please start writing all the facts in details, and tell us cleary: what happened to the Indus valley culture? did it disappear or continued as the Vedic culture?

This is exciting music, and you don't have to understand Spanish to get into the party feeling of this music... flamenco, latin pop, whatever you want to call it. Every album seems to have one standout pop booty shaker... I think Tequila claims this title, but Besame is cool, and Tu Eres Para Mi is Funky Cool, and Hay Que Matar a la Muerte pops with energy.

"Topper is Tops!: ... it's become my favorite video. Joan Blondell and Carole Landis--the ""poor man's Betty Grable""--are great as the two party gals who go to a spooky old mansion to claim the inheritance that Landis has been awarded. Billy Burke as Mrs. Topper is a scream and so is her side-kick maid, Patsy Kelly (no one could do a double-take better than patsy) and Rochester, as Cosmo Topper's man servant is hysterical. The beautiful camera-work, the women's gowns, the top-notch special effects and the hysterical sight-gags ranks this with the best of Abbott and Costello comedies. A terrific excuse to while away an hour and a half when you're feeling down or bored. Best Scene: the playful seal and Rochester.

"Vanessa's Harmonium: A Work Of Art: Vanessa Carlton's release of her second album shows how talented she really is. Her touch of piano to the tracks make the album what it is: original and breath taking.""White House"", ""Who's To Say"", ""Afterglow"", ""Private Radio"", ""Half A Week Before The Winter"", and ""She Floats"" stand out from the rest of the album. Each one reveals Vanessa's look on life from the past, present, and future. They also show how she see the world and what she wishes it could be.The rest of Harmonium contain tracks that are amazing as well, for they tell stories which are ear catching. This album is not what I expected it to be after hearing her debut one; Harmonium is a work of art.

"Harmonium: The Second Coming of Vanessa Carlton: Harmonium is such an incredible record, and it completely exceeds my initial expectations for Vanessa Carlton's sophomore album. It is a little different from 2002's Be Not Nobody in the sense that we are allowed to take a deeper look into Vanessa's beautiful, and sometimes dark, soul. I would have to say that most of the treasures on this record are the more upbeat songs. Some of these songs that steal the show are the bittersweet White Houses, a summer song about friendship, love, and loss, and Who's to Say, a song about choosing between family and a relationhip. Also, though a little dark, Annie shines on Harmonium. If you are not already a Nessaholic, you will be once you hear this talented ivory tickler show off her gift. Harmonium is in stores now, so go out and pick it up now!

"Plenty of Emotion: I don't agree that Clay shows no emotion. One needs only to listen to ""The Way"", ""Measure of a Man"", ""Run to Me"" ... or music from the AI season - ""Solitaire"", ""Here, There and Every Where"" to hear plenty of emotion and inflection. Let's not forget ""Silver Bells"" and ""Give a little love this Chrismas"" (forgive me if I got the title wrong). Hopefully some of you have had a chance to listen to some of his demo music with many spiritual songs and one song that brought me to tears ""I Will Be There"". Not only can this artist belt it out - he can also whisper softly and pull you right into the song. But I digress, as for my review of this CD, the problem is not the singer or the voice of the singer, but the weakness of the songs and their production. Hopefully, they will take more time with Clay's next CD and bring music to the table that matches his talent. I recommend the CD on the strength of Clay's voice and the way it makes you feel even the weaker songs.

"Awesome: Listened to the CD three times and love it. Catchy tunes I caught myself humming throughout the day. Love ballads that I so moving. Great mix of songs. It sure beats listening to some of the hard core music we have on the radio today. A few tunes were almost Beatles sounding. Clean and refreshing!!! Clay should just stay the way he is and his style should be left untarnished by the whoever tries to change it.

"Talent without good songs.: It is obvious that Clay Aiken has talent- there is no fooling about that. He is definitely one of the most talented pop stars out there right now. However, the people producing this album did a poor job showcasing the talent that Clay Aiken holds. Every song on this album sounds the same. The emotions portrayed by Clay are not very diverse; every emotion fits into either the category of ""I am singing about pain"" or ""We are going to get through the pain"". The truth is that this album is painful enough to actually sit and listen to. The only song on this less-than-quality debut that is worth listening to is the title track, ""Measure Of A Man."" This song is in a realm of its own, actually having a worthwhile message.In summation, the talent is there, the album is not. Maybe next time, Clay.

"california: I am highly entertained not by this horrible music but by the marketing scam perpetrated on the music buying public over and over. Tell them it's good, a thousnad times, and they will buy anything. It is an admirable thing to see Clive Davis become even more wealthy by pumping out more and more drivel for the masses to consume. A good clue to the quality of the five star reviews for this release can be found by the list of music purchases made by those who bought this CD:* CDs from The American Idol Series* Closer ~ Josh Groban* The Movie Album ~ Barbra Streisand* Bette Midler Sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook ~ Bette Midler* One Heart ~ Celine Dion* The Very Best Of Cher ~ Cher* Buddy Jewell ~ Buddy Jewell* Michael Buble [ENHANCED] ~ Michael BubleIf lack of taste were a crime, all involved with this release would be in jail.

"Measure of a Man's bad Material: Don't get me wrong, Clay is a wonderful vocalist. Really, truely, he is a gifted singer. But the big problem these days is that there are so many gifted singers who end up with horrible, stale, and downright creepy material. Has anyone actually listened to the lyrics to ""Invisible""? It sounds more like a stalker than a lonely everyman, and it's way creepy. His other songs all sound the same, and in some cases are laughably silly. I feel so let down. I wanted so much to love this album, because I love Clay, but it's just bad. Hopefully next time around Clay gets himself more worthy material, because if he continues down this path, he will end up forgotten. Please! Better material!

"marketing machine-wolf wearing sheep skin: Ok people. I like POP music, I do. I like good produced pop music even if artist is commercial. This CD is no different than Pink or Britney CD's as Mr. Clay is claiming to be, different that is. He said people are tired of fake pop stars. Well to tell you the truth, he is no different. It is marketing machine that is trying to tell people how he is so like you, ordinary and all nice, so you could buy his CD. Well that don't matter too much to me if the music is good, but this CD ain't nothing special. Ordinary power ballads with cheap lyrics. I also have message for Clay: Kid, good job with stories about how you're so different than Justin and Pink. American public eats them for lunch, and please now that you have money get someone else to write you album because this one sucks!!!

"Great voice, lousy material: This album is a MAJOR disappointment because Clay Aiken has so much promise as an entertainer. His charisma and talent, so evident on American Idol, are noticeably missing on this album of mediocre songs. The title alone was a bad choice - Kevin Sharp also released a ""Measure of a Man"" in the 90s (and was much more deserving to use it, since he was battling cancer at the time of its recording) and this collection of forgettable tracks won't give Clay the staying power he will need to stay afloat in the cutthroat entertainment world. Please, American Idol - you got them through the door, but that means nothing if they can't stay there. Bad album from a bright talent.

His singing, delivery and the CD's production are all terrific.My one complaint has more to do with music today than with Clay: Can't anyone write a good, up-tempo melody these days?? Some of these songs are just boring. But then again, I find that to be the case with most of what's on the radio nowadays. (Everything is either slow and boring or fast and insipid.) My favorite Clay moments from American Idol were when he sang faster songs - Billy Joel, Grease, Buttercup - so I know he can definitely sing uptempo songs. I just hope he does on the next album!

I think this should be his next single. Their will be some that don't like it because its not edgy enough. Who cares. I'm sick of the negative reviews. If they want to have edge and profanity in their music there are plenty of other artists out there to choose from. Sorry, for going off there.

Sorry, Clay....you might have been second in American Idol II...but you are NOT Barry Manilow! I just have a problem with someone who has to use a tv show to get noticed instead of using their god-given talents and merits to get to superstardom. It smacks in the face of those who have real talent and are struggling to be heard and appreciated by the music industry and the public. So many good singers are passed up because of tripe like this. Please, spend your money wisely and don't buy this CD. Go out and get yourself ULTIMATE BARRY MANILOW or even a good Celine Dion disc instead. At least those folks worked for years to get where they are...and obviously have some talent. Clay, I wish you luck...but I am sure your career will be history in about a year.

""Measure Of A Man"" CD is exciting and is the best debut CD by a male musical artist in the past 3 years.

I don't want some guy on my wall watching me ge undressed.Clay got on American Idol to become the famous person that he is. If it wasn't for that show then he would still be a nobody teacher. He has a normal voice. Nothing that someone in a church choir doesn't have.I think that if you are going to blow your money on real music, then you should buy Josh Groban.

I can't understand what motivates these outstanding reviews for a album that's not worthy of them. These songs are about exciting as Muzak.

Now, I think its actually very well done, and Clay's vocals on the album are absolutely incredible.For those who were unimpressed with the album, I encourage you to listen to it again...maybe even twice. If you still don't like it, fine - shelf it...but I think you'll find it will grow on you.It seems a lot of people had a similar experience....the more they listened, the more they liked it.

"CLAY AIKEN IS THE BEST: I fell in love with him when he first auditioned on American Idol 2. I was praying for him the whole way through and was disappointed when he lost to Ruben. But his sales prove that he should have been the American Idol. I bought his CD the second day it came out, I had been waiting for it for so long and I was not disappointed at all. He sounds wonderful and it feels as if he's singing only to you. If you have a good ear and know good music when you hear it, this CD is for you!! There aren't many good singers left so I'm thankful he's blessed with this gift.

"Why I Hate Potato Chips: Actually I love Potato Chips...this just plain SUCKS. What is wrong with you people?! Must you follow and do everything a ""reality"" show tells you to do? And this guy supposeldy freakin' LOST! There's something wrong here folks. When society is reduced this low and forget such classics and Beethoven and Mozart Concertos, Classic rock like Floyd or Zepplin, even modern music like Dream Theater and Nightwish...there is something wrong with American Society.Just like with Potato Chips...you don't know when the frell to stop!

"Decent Tunes.: I'm not really into pop music. I really like rap and R&B, but I can really dig a great voice. So what can I say? Clay Aiken got a real good voice, soul, power, and range. The songs are a bit predictable and not very challenging, but the dude Aiken racks up all the songs. Touch is a good song, proving that Aiken should explore hip hop a little. When You Say You Love Me has a country sound to it. I DO NOT LIKE country music. I didn't like this song either, but it got itself on in my head for hours. I did like Invincible. Clay can really shake it up. He displays his impressive range in Run To Me and Measure of Man. Perfect Day and No More Sad Songs have a rock edge. The Way and Shine and Run To Me are soulful ballads. I liked Aiken's voice better than the songs. Hopefully, he picks some better song writers next time.

"It Is All About The Voice!!!!!: Clay Aiken's voice stands out more than any other singer I have listened to. It inspires, makes you feel good, excites and is just nice to listen to. I can put his 'Measure Of A Man' CD and listen to EVERY song again, again. Very rare for albums now a days, to have every song enjoyable.1. Invisible - Up tempo pop; catchy and very enjoyable.2. I Will Carry You - Emotional, make you feel good ballad.3. The Way - Again, emotional, make you feel good ballad.4. When You Say You Love Me - Easy listening, country ballad.5. No More Sad Songs - Good ballad, great main chorus.6. Run To Me - Strong ballad.7. Shine - nice listening ballad, Clay sounds very caring.8. I Survived You - Strong ballad.9. This Is The Night - His trademark, awesome ballad.10. Perfect Day - Up tempo ballad, very good.11. Measure Of A Man - Powerful ballad, very emotional.12. Touch - Up tempo, very good.A must have CD. I cannot wait until his next CD.

I find myself singing along to the music--not that you want to hear me singing. God Bless Mr. Aiken in his future endeavors!!

"Doesn't do it.: I've honestly heard this entire album, I'm glad that I didn't buy it. Everything sounds almost the same and I find myself getting bored with his voice. I'm a big fan of everyone on AI, so I listen to every song first before I judge. I would say Kelly Clarkson and Ruben Studdard's CD's are better than this. Please, do yourself a favor and buy those instead, not this. I would recommend maybe downloading some of Clay's songs, but don't spend your money.

"Let the Revolution Begin...: After the massive success of Clay Aiken's first single, ""This is the Night"", the expectations were high for his debut album. Luckily, Aiken does not disappoint. From the catchy, up-tempo single ""Invisible"" to the touching and emotive title track, ""Measure of a Man"", this cd provides a fantastic balance of lyrical depth and impressive vocal range. While some think his powerful voice is better suited for Broadway, this impeccable debut cd proves that Clay has the capability of being a phenomenal recording artist. In an industry full of sell-outs and talentless clones, it's refreshing to experience an artist as gifted and genuine as Clay Aiken.

The songs are powerful and sung to perfection by Clay. Every song is really great, and you will definitely listen to this album over and over.

"This album deserves NEGATIVE 10 STARS!: Why would any lucid human being waste their money buying this junk? This isnt music. This is contrived and manufactured. I don't watch american idol and i never would because it's a awful t.v show that degenarates everything good about music. The ONLY people who buy this are clueless teenaged girls who know ZILCH about music, and and middle aged woman who buy this for their kids to TORTURE them!! Way too sappy, way too bland. This is safe music for people afraid to listen to music that takes risks and challenges them intellectually. Clay Aiken should stop covering songs from The Beatles and Simon and Garfunkel. He's destroying those classics with his ""broadwayesque"" voice. The Beatles were actual artists who took risks in music and were innovative. Clay is nothing like that. Just another talentless popstar getting his 15 minutes of fame and then will fade away into oblivion. The sooner the better!!!

It is apparent that he has such a big heart and he puts so much feeling into his songs. It doesn't matter what he sings, he does an outstanding job. I bought his album and I have to say I think its the best FIRST album of any american idol thus far. Any song he sings that broadcasts his voice range just awes me. Anybody that doesn't think this young man is talented needs to have their hearing checked. He is Spectacular! In my opinion Clay should have won AI..hands down! Definitely an album worth owning.

"This album is not as good as they make it seem: Only Claymates like it and his fans are buying his way. Mr. Aiken has a large internet fan base who are purchasing multiples to boost his sales to make the album appear to be great, however, they have to beg radio to play it. Here is a response from a radio station:QUOTE: ""As of right now, we have no plans to add ""Invisible"" to our playlist.Interest in the song is strictly limited to fans of Clay Aiken.People outside the ""Claymate"" realm really aren't that into the song.The video isn't even getting substantial play on MTV or VH-1.You may want to try our sister station.The song has more of an Adult Contemporary feel to it.Good luck!""

"What a cutie!: When I think of Clay, the first phrase that comes to mind is ""Awwwwwww..."" He is just so cute! And, for once, he's a cutie who can actually sing(!!!) His voice is tremendous, and his songs showcase his voice well. I was a faithful Idol 2 viewer, and rooted for Clay from Day 1. I am delighted to see how much he has grown as an artist (Ruben who?), and how he has overpowered all of the other Idols in popularity, album sales, and TV appearances.My only complaint is the lack of song variety. There's a point where all of the songs start to sound the same, and the only reason that you keep on listening is because, well, it's Clay!He's my favorite Idol!

"Sublime Voice; Songs don't always measure up: Clay's voice soars to new territory on this CD, particularly on songs like ""Touch"" and ""Run to Me"" and ""Invisible"", which could otherwise be categorized as ho-hum pop music, if Clay wasn't singing them. The lyrics are a little corny, but Clay makes them sound sincere. The vocal range of most of these songs is not very great, and thus they don't properly show off Clay's unique tenor to-die-for voice.I wish that the ""experts"" who molded some of these songs would have kept their involvement in the project to a minimum, and left the songs pure, instead of processing them with pop synthesizer sounds. I can hear that on any modern day pop album, and it is not very special. On the other hand, I can only hear Clay's voice on a few CD's. And his true voice is great enough that it shouldn't be crowded by synthesizer warble.

"Teen Titan Tower falls apart: This toy is absolutely terrible. I gave it one star, only because zero is not an option. My son really wanted this toy, and when he got it, he played with it for about 5 minutes, and walked away. Even a four year old can see how lame this toy is. It comes with a trigger that is supposed to eject some kind of orange ramp to launch a car. Nice concept, except the thing doesn't come out all the way, so my son ends up pulling the thing out. There are missiles that are supposed to attach to the side according to the instructions, they don't. The tower keeps falling off of it. All around, I can't believe how poorly designed this toy is for the money. You would think I bought it at the dollar store or something. I would urge all who consider buying this toy, to talk your kid into something else. IT'S TERRIBLE!!!

"OK Toy: I have to agree with alot of the other posts on this one. Santa brought this for my daughter, who loves teen titans, for Christmas. The instructions, what there is of them, is very hard to decipher. The orange launch thing would not work and I had to take apart the little red switch that the control thing fits on to make the organge track pop out. (the red switch was not in the right position from factory). Even then the orange track does not fold all the way out. Also, like alot of other reviewers the tower tips over very easily. I just don't feel like I am getting what I am paying for these days when it comes to toys.

"Good stuff!: I take this daily and it seems to have assisted with my acne and other health complaints. A higher dose helped considerably with the common cold (along with taking Vitamin C and garlic); the extra immune system boost helped me get over it within 2 days as opposed to the usual 5 with garlic/C. I cut one vcap open to help with a cystic acne spot that was bothering me. I rubbed the oregano ointment on the skin, let it sit overnight covered with a bandage, and the spot had shrunk considerably by morning. Is this the placebo effect in action? Perhaps, but I don't see the harm in using it if this is the case. At least it seems to help.

"Do not be deceived!: This version of ""Beowulf"" should NOT be compared, at all, to the original text of ""Beowulf"". Students should not be taught that THIS story, as re-created by Robert Nye, is reflective of the ""Beowulf"" written about 1000 AD. The story developed and shared for hundreds of years is characterized by Christian concepts and ideals. This version, written by Robert Nye, reflects our societies overwhelming desire to rewrite history, de-Christianizing it as they go along. Robert Nye has replaced the Christian God of the original ""Beowulf"" with the mythological Viking god ""Odin"". The original ""Beowulf"" tale supports the historical significance that Christian beliefs and ideas had on the overall society of England and throughout Europe. Robert Nye has done a great injustice in adjusting an historical document to reflect his own convictions, or lack thereof.

This book has been praised as an influence by some very great authors, but I must assume it was the theme and not the narrative itself that caught their fancy.

"Through the Madness!!!: First of all, Ike is doing the very thing that Tina always said he would do. Ike Turner will never admit to what he did to Tina. Tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like ""all the others."" Ike took advantage of her. Tina her self said she cared very much for him. Cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince Tina to leave him. Even the girls that danced with Tina on stage had whitnessed what happened.Tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career, she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on. So she released her autobiography in 1986, well after her come-back in 1984.While Ike can try to deny it all he wants, the truth is he violently abused Tina! And considering the person Ike Turner is, I would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic-excusse of a come-back!!!

I could perhaps forgive this if there was something else good about the series, unfortunately they have really destroyed what was a good series, I have watched 4 episodes and am unsure I will watch any more, the acting is poor, the storyline is worse, the new characters are uninspired and I have no motivation to watch any more as its definitely not getting any better.

I loved introducing her to Halloween from a book that emphasized friendship and generosity among neighbors, rather than scary monsters, pranks, or candy. The illustrations were lovely. I'm sure the original edition had beautiful illustrations too, and the previous reviewer might have been chagrinned by the changes to a personal childhood favorite. But I'm guessing that most people who, like my family, discover the story for the the first time in this edition will find nothing amiss.

They come out of the dryer pretty good w/o wrinkles if you use the wrinkle-guard cycle. However, the shirt in the picture is not at all what they send you. The shirt in this pic above has a much tougher, textured material, and the actual shirt has a white label, not black as in the pic. So, expect a very thin, smooth, untextured but stylish shirt, with crisp collars that look good that comes out of the dryer nice, but the shirt in the pic is not the shirt you get.

"A disappointing read for the 21st century: This book is a classic. No question. That's why I chose to read it. When it came out in the 1860s, it was science fiction and gripped the imaginations of many. A ship that could travel under the water! But reading it in 2010, much of the novelty of the book has been realized. We have had submarines for nearly a century.But even aside from that, there is little plot to the novel. It reads as if it were written by a committee at National Geographic. It's a survey of all the unique items and places in the world's oceans. The little plot there is involves the protagonist trying to escape from the ship. And the ending (not to ruin it...) is a total cop-out and disappointing.I was hoping this book would stand the test of time, like The Time Machine or even Around the World in 80 Days. But I found it a rather boring and drudging read.

"Twenty Thousand Leagues: A mysterious creature is haunting the seas, and Professor Aronnax is determined to discover the origins of the beast. However, the encounter brings more than he ever expected, as he is captured by the strange and withdrawn captain of a submarine ship and whirled around the world's oceans. The aquatic wonders he experiences thrill his academic soul, while the actions and motivations of his host leave him questioning both the individual and civilizations at large.Verne's underwater adventure is the latest novel I have read to my toddler at bedtime, and is far from my favorite. As we finished the third Verne novel we have approached I found myself lamenting a brilliant story bogged down by careless prose; I found that the language was flat and uninspired, and the sentence structure was unbelievably choppy. The failings of the writing itself took away from what would otherwise have been a book full of wonders, and I believe we will leave Verne buried once and for all.

"A REAL MESS: SNL deserves a comprehensive overview that tells us how they put together the show and how/why it matters/mattered. This is not that book. The author simply has no objectivity so he can't tell us the truth. If you want to read what you already know about the show's popular sketches this is the book to read. We learn almost nothing about how personalities worked together- or not- to make the show last this long. Far too little time is spent on the first 5 years and that first amazing cast. But if you want to hear about 'Pat' and Victoria Jackson this is the book for you. A real mess.

"Very Disappointing: If you enjoyed the book, you won't want to watch the Disney version of this movie. Characterization was changed (a friendly dwarf became a nasty grump, Prince Caspian and King Peter had jealousy issues); scenes were added that weren't in the book, and basically all of the best parts of the book were omitted. There were battles that never took place. In fact, fighting was the main focus of this movie. Anything that had any hint of spirituality was obliterated from the movie. If Disney wanted to create a fantasy battle movie, they should have just hired someone to write one. Prince Caspian is definitely NOT the Prince Caspian that C.S. Lewis wrote. I will definitely not watch any more Disney adaptations of Narnia.

"Too Precious: Too long and too precious. This second Narnia film still finds the children in wartime England waiting for a train when they are abruptly called back to Narnia. Hundreds of years after their visit from the wardrobe, once again evil outsiders are threatening to overwhelm the animals and folk of Narnia's forests. The children eventually save the day and return to the train station after heroic battles and soul searching speechifying. Although technically amazing, the story is drawn out to a sense of boredom and the characters, other than the children, lack a strength and sharpness that made the first film so enjoyable. It isn't a film we'll watch again and again as we have Wardrobe.

"One of the worst mountaineering books I have ever read.: Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, ""lesser climbers"", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American ""analysis"" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so.

Think Nicholson Baker writing ""Into Thin Air"" from the point of view of Sandy Hill Pittman.

"Excellent Series, Poor DVD casing: The series is excellent and faithful to the literary history surrounding the Robin Hood legends. Clannad's music adds a bit of authenticity, as does the use of magic and superstition, and the UK setting.Acorn did a reasonably good job digitizing and adding subtitles to the original film. Colour was on the dark side, but nothing that can't be adjusted.The poor packaging of the 'complete' set prevents me from giving it a perfect score. I like the look and the folding-book concept of it, but the casing is made of hard plastic, making it prone to chipping and difficult to remove the DVDs carefully without breaking or cracking them. I had a similar problem with the ""I Spy - Four-Pack Collection"" cases. So, take care to remove the DVDs lest you damage them permanently. You might consider alternative storage like a plastic CD envelope case, considering this DVD set is not cheap.Aside from this, I highly recommend the complete Robin Hood set.

""Of course"" the people quoting the figures must be right with numbers on their sides... until you look at just how those numbers were arrived at.This book isn't truly a guide on how to lie with statistics, but it is an excellent text that informs the reader both how others will lie to them using statistics and on how to interpret the validity of purported statistical data.

"Clear, Concise, and Fun: How to Lie with Statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics.

How to Lie with Statistics is perfect for the beginning statistics student or anyone who wants to learn how they can be decieved through the manipulation of numbers. The reading level and math make this more appropriate for high school or college students than for younger students. Using three randomly selected paragraphs, the mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 10.4; thus this book is excellent for sophomores or advanced freshman.

I especially liked the depictions of Latter-Day Saints in nations outside the United States, including the temple trip down the Amazon and a few shots of Victoria Peak! Beliver or no, these pictures tell 10,000 words about a people that are industrious, optimistic, and compassionate. These photos aver that while many continue to criticize and ostracize this church, the Latter-Day Saints frequently hold the moral/ethical highground on their idealogical opponents.

I most enjoyed the idea of the go-cart club. The inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that I have read in a long while. The book also has a sense of being a bit personal. I do not know Henry Bromell, only that he is good friends with ny english teacher, but from reading this book I have a sense that I know a little about him. That is why I believe people write books, is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life. He has, in my opinion, succeeded in doing so with Little America.

"Disappointing: Fine as an introduction to Duncan, but not for serious study. At best, this is a ""Greatest Hits"" record--though that said, it's a bit like buying Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits. It's good in that it touches every portion of his career, but since Duncan worked so fiercely in the poetics of the series and the idea of ""the book of poetry,"" ultimately it leaves the reader wanting.

"Bad quality zipper: We outgrew our 8x8 tents with the kids, so we bought this tent preparing for our next camp trip. We test it out at our back yard right after we bought it. It's easy to set up, and roommy. However, the zippers are done in very low end quality. The window zippers work ok, but both the door zipper did not work well! The mesh zipper will open up after you zipped it. The door zipper is not well stiched on one side! And it's hard to zip it around.We are return it back to the store tomorrow!

But the last two times I bought it from Perfume World or I give someone to use, I have noticed that it smells worse than sweat - horrible. I don’t believe this is the original perfume.

"Unsupported by the Constitution: Yoo's arguments in favor of an essentially unchecked executive fly in the face of everything that the Founders intended when creating our great country. He is undoubtedly intelligent, given the prowess with which he manipulates the Constitution and legal precepts into seemingly supporting his own theory. Despite the packaging, however, the fundamental basis for his theory is fatally flawed. He is, at his core, merely an opportunist who advocates theories for the sole purpose of furthering his own career, rather than because they actually have merit. In other words, he's just a hack at heart. This book isn't worth your time or money.

As a general book on growing, it's not bad, but anything that purports itself as being a ""grow bible"" should include extensive information on evaluating hydroponics systems and mediums and how to use and maintain them throughout a grow. This book contains some information on this, but not nearly enough. For whatever reasons, it includes far more information on genetics and breeding, but most growers I know buy clones or seeds. Those pages would have been better devoted to all things hydroponics.Is there a good book focused primarily on indoor hydroponic growing?

I wish an author with a bit of distance and vision would have done the actual writing of this book. As it is, Brokaw cannonizes his subjects and does a poor job telling the real story. I hope this topic gets explored further by someone other than Brokaw, who has little talent as a writer.

"Good idea, but shallow text and a distorted picture: Brokaw writes not like a veteran newsman, but like an awestruck, hero-worshipping kid. That's not a crime, but one expects more from a man with Brokaw's experience and training. I felt the text was very shallow -- especially in the final section when he interviews celebrities. One doesn't learn a lot in this section. Nor does one get any meaningful insights. I also felt there was a tremendous ""sameness"" about the interviews. Surely, there were people who had bitter memories or less than passionately patriotic views. Brokaw could have presented a more accurate picture of the generation by including a dissenting opinion or two. Regrettably, one has to wonder about the accuracy of his reporting on NBC News.

"A book of simple hurra patriotism: I used to enjoy Tom Brokaw when he was NBC anchor man as a critical and competent journalist. His book however is a real disappiontment.

Not everything this generation did was so great and I would have expected from a critical journalist like Tom Brokaw to take this aspect into consideration as well. In this sense it is not very demanding book.

"A significant book in psychology and the Bible: Johnson, a clinical psychologist who is a graduate of Fuller Seminary and Fuller Graduate School of Psychology, writes a clear and careful study of the psychological factors that can unconsciously affect the way people read the Bible. He points out how issues of perception, cognitive process, social interaction, and culture can shape how a person interprets scripture. He writes from a committed Evangelical position, and is not by any means reducing the meaning of scripture to merely human processes or psychology. Still, he does caution against the naivete that says, ""I don't interpret the Bible, I just read what it says.""This is an essential volume for anyone interested in psychology, religion, and the Bible.

"A great guide in simple terms!: A great, comprehensive guide that helped me to understand why this happened in a historical context. Also helped me to get a better grasp of what to expect with the war against Afghanistan and Al Qaeda. Now I know why this happened and what to expect. The news media seems to breeze over historical elements in favor of status quo Anthrax and millitary events but this book really helped me to get caught up on my facts. Highly recommended!

"more than ""disco"": In the begining thier was house.......and before that thier was SALSOUL!!!! The root of house music started with salsoul. This cd captures some of the best songs that they produced. To say that this is just another disco cd, would be doing it a grave disjustice. It would be like calling the Mona Lisa just a painting or the statue of Dave just a rock. This is a compilation of the best dance music ever recorded. The blend of rebel rosing vocals and smooth lyrical contents with the monstrative rythems are timeless classics. My only regret is they didn't release all of thier gems out on one compliation. This is a must have for any disco, house, dance, or r&b collection.

"Childhood favorite: This was an important book to me when I was a little girl growing up in Colorado. I couldn't tell you how many times I checked it out of the library to read and reread again. I even remember where it was -- second shelf from the end, three row up, reddish hardback cover.Over the years I'd forgotten the title, I just remembered that it was about a little Native American girl who climbed a tree and found another world in the sky. After a tedious search of my old towns online library (yay for modern internet searches) I found a title that rung a bell and won a copy on ebay!I'm so happy to have this book on my shelf now. Wonderful, wonderful story.

"""You Get What You Pay For""!: I have purchased several bluetooth headsets in my attempt to obtain a good quality sound. I purchased the Nextlink AX2 with the hopes of solving my search. I was not impressed. It was loud enough (as they stated), but with the volume turned up it created an echo for the recipient of the call. It is a ROYAL pain trying to get the thing in your ear while driving. Once in, it was fine. I hung up on several calls while attempting to secure it in my ear.I have put the whole thing back in the package and will try to return (though for the $30 less shipping both ways) it probably isn't worth my time.I have gone to the expensive H700 MotorolaAs they say -""you get what you pay for""

"Serious flaw with this bike rack. Screws made of PLASTIC!: At first glance this rack seems well designed. In fact when I first put it on my car it felt very secure. However, after 3 days I noticed that one of the inner arms was loose. On closer inspection I realized that the screw that tightens the arm was defective and wouldn't tighten. After pulling it out I wasn't surprised because the screw is made of plastic. I couldn't believe it. The entire rack was total garbage because of one plastic screw. The screw is not replaceable with something from your local hardware store either. It is a specialty screw with a large cap on it that lets you hand tighten it. I can't believe that Saris would do this just to save a few bucks. This rack went back to Amazon and good riddance.

"Best Keep As A Secret: This is a story with a modicum of drama except for a small dog (surprising given the starry nature of the human cast), close to nonexistence suspense, and muddy sound recording compounded with hard to understand dialog (English accents and all that). Gielgud's performance as the hero is mostly one dimensional (when you can understand his delivery); as the heroine, Carroll's ""acting"" ranges from chatty to zombie; and Lorrie's delivery is over-the-top ham (and, quite frankly, an embarrassment) as he portrays the ""good-guy"" killer. All this is in marked contrast to the achievements of the fourth principal performer, Robert Young. Young provides an acting tour de force as the subject matter of the film. He makes the film his own!There are some gee-wiz (for the time, 1936) special in-camera/editing effects which were then fast becoming (and would continue to be) a Hitchcock trademark.Not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces, but not one of his disasters either.WILLIAM FLANIGAN, Ph.D

"Another great Feinstein golf book: Feinstein takes a different tack in The Open versus his previous golf books, A Good Walk Spoiled and The Majors. Instead of stories about the players on the tour, this story focuses on the people behind the transformation of the worn-out municipal golf course Bethpage Black into the great course that hosted the 2002 U.S. Open championship. I found I couldn't stop reading, as Feinstein's prose is once again funny, heartwarming, and flowing. My only critique is that I wished for more detail on Rees Jones' changes to A.G. Tillinghast's design, with illustrations. For a book about the transformation of the golf course, there isn't enough about the physical changes that were done. The book does a great job portraying the enormity of the project that was undertaken, so the satisfaction that is felt with the success of the championship seems to be well deserved.

"A Good Open Spoiled: The subtitle should be, ""Inside the Port-o-Johns at Bethpage Black,"" because Feinstein devotes many pages to the man who set up all those portable toilets that lined the golf course, every last one, even one that Tiger briefly did some business in! The guy who unloaded the Port-o-Johns off the truck is interesting for about a clause, but we get page after page of this guy. You'd think he was the Pope of Bethpage Black. If you want to know fascinating stuff like the PRECISE NUMBER of Port-O-Johns that actually lined the golf course, then attempt to burrow your way through Open. The playing of golf -- I'm talking about the first actual golf shot of the tournament -- doesn't make its first appearance until page 256. At that point, the book is more than two-thirds over!!!Feinstein phoned this one in. Did someone edit this? He should have called it, ""A Good Open Spoiled."" Don't waste your money.

"One of the Best Texts in ""Calculus Reform"": If you read it through and through, you will find how wonderful it is to approach calculus in a graphical, numerical and symbolic way. If you want to challenge your mind in this way, this book is probably the most suitable for you. I am using it in my calculus calss, and I found the concepts are very clearly explained. The thing that I love most of this book is that it helps students develop a good understanding of calculus through observing and studying the graphs of the functions. This only imperfection of the book, if any, is that there lack of some theoretical exercises. But any book can not be perfect. The most important thing is how you enjoy it. For me, it is a new and fresh guide of the study of calculus.

"Nearly useless as a calculus textbook: I am a fan of traditional theorem-proof exposition, and this Ostebee-Zorn text demonstrates why. This book attempts to make calculus easy to understand, but the only result is that it is impossible to follow. Essential concepts are buried deep within piles of verbiage, and the examples skip important steps making them hard to follow. Add to that the large number of typos and errors in the solutions manual. As a teaching assistant, I have had strong mathematics students who could not understand this book and whose knowledge of calculus suffered as a result. With so many quality calculus textbooks on the market, it is hard to understand why a school would choose to use this unsuccessful experiment.

If ""What's the Story Morning Glory"" defined and popularized Brit-pop, ""Be Here Now"" sounded its death knell! I will admit that the sound is much like older Oasis recordings, but that's just the problem. It's TOO much like the older stuff and sounds suspiciously like the Gallaghers were in a hurry to turn out something - anything - a.s.a.p. What makes this album so bad is that it was hyped SO much, which left this Oasis fan with a sharp sense of being taken for a ride. Oasis may be the most popular British band, but they aren't the best.

"This one amazing album!!!: I like Oasis because their songs are rhythmic and I like the lead singer's voice. All of their songs have a different rhythmic and all songs are really good. There are 12 songs on this album. I like the 4th song "" STAND BY ME "" because it's really nice when they say ` stand by me, nobody knows the way it's gonna be ` I like these parts!!! And the 8th song "" DON'T GO AWAY "" is good , too. I found this song is for when something sad has happened to you; It's one of the best song in this album!! So I think this album is fantastic!!!!! I want Oasis to sing many songs.

Even though it sounded something like Frank Sinatra would write it still has the Billy Joel feel. Both with the music and timing. As this fan grows older this is a welcome sound.

"Great book: Like Eragon...I first watched the movie and really enjoyed it. Afterwards I read the book and realized that the movie was horribly done when compared to the book.I liked all of the character building in the book and thought it had plenty of humor and action. There was no sex and cussing (that I remember) in the book for those that don't like to read that sort of stuff.On a side note...my inner immaturity laughed when the words 'fagged' and 'ejaculated' were used to describe feelings and expressions.Five stars!

"THE HUMPER STILL DEFINES (AND REDEFINES) LOVE: If you can get past the cover and inside photos --- a Humper who looks suspiciously surgically streamlined --- you will be for a warm, fuzzy surprise. The Humper still has it: smooth vocals with a blend of country and pop and the softest of rock possible, all showcased with his three-and-a-half octave range. There are covers --- ""Volare,"" ""Penny Lane"" (perhaps an homage to The Beatles, the group whom he knocked off the charts with his No. 1 hit, ""Release Me""), ""If Tomorrow Never Comes,"" ""This Guy's in Love With You"" and the underrated Aznavour anthem ""She."" There's an infectious taste of calypso with ""Brazil,"" and a truly likable country-flavored "" How Slow We Go,"" co-written by the Humper's daughter, Louise. The best track is the title track, ""Definition of Love"" --- proof, indeed, that the man still defines love. Now a bad way to celebrate 35 years in the business of making love on the record.

"Not worth the time: I checked this book out from my local La Leche League. I'm surprised they still have this book available. Being nearly twenty years old, maybe some of my problems are with it being outdated. However, my main gripe is that it is very condescending and judgmental. Instead of just informing you on different options (none of which would work for me and only one or so that would apply well to a full time job) this book presents a certain ideal and if the job arrangements do not fit that ideal, they're not good arrangements and you aren't a good mother. If you want helpful, non-opinionated advice, this is not the book for you. Currently I'm reading ""The Working Mother's Guide to Life"" which seems much more friendly and helpful.

"Doesn't Work!: For all the famous names in this movie, soomething better should have come out of it. It was predictable from the first, and the twists and turns were just silly. They couldn't leave the estate, although one of them managed to arrive from the outside. Just about every one was involved in something illicit, or at least in something strange. Lovers were talked about but not really discussed. The biggest bombshell involving supposed incest was discussed by just two of the eight and nothing was made of it.

Sometimes its just enough to put them on, flip the power switch and relax, without actually hooking them up to listen to something.

"Excellent Audio, Poor Physical Construction: I've owned my pair for close to four years now and they are starting to physically deteriorate.

But at this point the plastic upright on each earphone has broken and needs to be held together with wire ties, and the rubber cover on one of the ear pieces has worn through. Granted, I use them almost every day, but they don't see rough use - and this isn't the type of endurance I'd expect from a $300 product. The two year warranty isn't long enough to address these issues.UPDATED JANUARY 2009One of the ear pieces finally cracked at the pivot point and simply fell off.

"Review Style comment: If you are a batman fan this is the movie to see. We start at Bruce Wayne's beginnings and travel with him as he trains to become the Dark Knight.The script was approved by DC comics and therefore holds more truth to the original story than the ""Batman"" movies before it. Christian Bale was a really great casting choice as he has the duality to play both the suave Bruce Wayne and the haunted Batman. Micheal Caine, Liam Neeson, and Morgan Freeman played their characters with the great skill that we've come to expect from these legendary actors. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Dr. Jonathan Crane was amazing and complex. I look forward to the next movie in this remarkable new series.

"The Best Batman: As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot. While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others. You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place. Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great. The whole movie had fantastic casting. Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen. I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.

The BEST Batman movie was the 1989 Tim Burton original. Batman Returns comes next and Batman Begins is somewhere around there. The Schumacher ones,while not being superb, still have their moments.The Batsuit did make Bale look sometimes like FATman. The Batarangs were rusty looking and not cool enough.

"Would Not Recommend this Toy: My 2 year old son received this toy as a gift. Although he somewhat enjoys playing with it, I was seriously disappointed with the functionality of the click bricks.First, the click bricks don't 'stick' together well. If you pick up two joined sections or try to reposition them they fall apart -- very frustrating for a 2 year old!! I think the magnets are way too weak. Some of the magnets don't work at all!Second, you can't really build much of anything with the pieces in this set. They have some neat pictures of built projects on the box, but good luck recreating them!I would absolutely not recommend this toy.

If you can get them to click you are lucky. You can not build anything with this set. The box shows a house, buildings, etc., but you can't build these thing because the magnets are in the wrong places and the roofs make the whole thing top heavy!I would avoid this set unless you just really need Bob and Wendy (like us).

"Could be better: I've had this windshield mount for a few months now, and while it works, I can't really say that I would recommend it to anyone else.As the other review said, it shakes quite a bit while driving. However, that is bearable compared to the real problem--the pivot head is just not very sturdy. Hitting the smallest bumps on the road, or even just turning, could cause the pivot head to swivel, leaving your PSP in a slanted position.The pivot head swivels while driving whether or not I have the PSP docked in the windshield mount, so it's not an issue of weight. I end up having to adjust its position every few minutes, which is not exactly the safest thing to have to do while driving.

The synths sound fantastic and the percussion has a nice amount of grainy distortion added so that the tracks are rarely boring, if at all - they pound, scream and soar through the average sonic boundary.I agree with Virus mag's review in that this album is not the most original thing out there, but the concept of the album is interesting and keeps it all pieced together. There's nothing bad about this album per se, but nothing really grabs my attention as being too exciting in terms of originality.Nevertheless, a good album for fans of dark electro/industrial/terror EBM.

"Athletic Director: GoFit Vest great to work with regarding ease of putting it on and especially the velco straps to hold it together. We use it in spiking and agility drills for volleyball. It still allows the arm and shoulder to be used effectively and we really like the weight distributed in the front rather than on the shoulders or back. Highly recommend!!

"GoFit 10 lb walking vest: This was a really good investment. I use it during some of my aerobic exercise dvds and I walk/jog/run with it on. The only negative is that you can't wear it on the outside of your clothing, because it looks like a bulletproof vest and then there are a lot of eyes staring at you. So, I decided to wear it under my clothing, it is a little bulky but it isn't so bad. I highly recommend it for someone who is new to to the vest.

Since I had never used a walking vest, I wanted to start out as recommended with lighter than 10 pounds so removed some of the weights. These were not so easy to get out of the pouches but that means they are securely held in place. I am well pleased with this GoFit walking vest.

"Great product.: I was hesitant to buy this for my new MacBook Pro, but I'm glad I did. I took a little getting used to, but it fits very well over the keys with minimal typing interference. It's not completely transparent so it does cloud the key symbols a little bit, but not enough to make them unreadable in normal light or when the backlighting is on. I don't have any problems with it sticking to the screen (I have the regular, not glossy screen) when the cover is closed. This is cheap insurance for your computer. Liquid spills into the keyboard of a laptop computer are a disaster. The repair will be very expensive and will not be covered under warranty.

"STRUGGLE OF WOMEN: I was disappointed in this book. I am searching for a book that is equally as awesome as 'A Virtuous Woman', but it looks like Kaye Gibbons isn't going to give it to us. In this book the women are survivors because they have to be. I was disappointed in the cold, compassionless character of Charlie Kate. Her character shined through her words and actions: beneath that arrogant surface lay a very insecure, unsatisfied, unfulfilled, and angry person. I can understand why she didn't have a man: who would want her? Her hatred of men, I think, was more of a jealousy. She had no compassion, so she tried to make up for it in her 'intelligence' and 'literacy'. She tried to hide behind those midwife skills. Although the book was long, it was shallow and I expected a deeper plot.

"Transitions: I am an avid fan of DM, and will do the best job at being objective about their work. Although, I think this album is great and it has many quintessential DM songs, there are some songs that I often skip over. These songs are definitely not my favorites, but I think mostly that they just don't appeal to me in the context of this album. This is why I label this ""transitions"". I love all periods of DM, but I notice this one seems to be one that incorporates the earlier ""new wave"" feeling of previous albums but also ushers in the darker era of DM. I tend to prefer the darker DM, but appreciate the earlier work especially if not simultaneously. If you are even a slight fan of their work, you will enjoy this album.

Both Fiorenza Cossotto and Alfredo Kraus are at their peak. To say nothing of Sesto Bruscantini and Ruggero Raimondi in supporting roles.

"Excellent Stories, So-So Analysis: I enjoyed all but one of the 11 stories in this book from 1927 to 2002. Even though I didn't enjoy Pamela Zoline's ""The Heat Death of the Universe"" I can see why it is an important story to include in this collection of some of the science fiction that can be seen as feminist. ""seen as feminist"" here is the key I think especially when you look at the essays paired with each story. A few of the essays were spot on -- looked at the author and the story in their historical context. Others rambled between sharing previous scholarship and trying to find multiple readings of the material one of which was a feminist interpretation. The 11 stories are intense and moving, challenging the reader while entertaining. I loved that they were organized chronologically because I could see a flow and development of the feminist voice. I wish a concluding essay had tied them all together to bring this out more.

"Rational Anti-mysticism: Healthy debunking: Islamic Mysticism: A Secular Perspective by Ibn Al-Rawandi (Prometheus Books) Any believer needs to fairly read some debunking views of one's beliefs. First it is always important to know other points of view, even if they do not persuade or even tend to subvert the truth of the positions one holds as true and life-saving. This book offers a critique of the Sufi path of transformation by a former seeker who feels there is serious deception and self-deception on the spiritual path and it is better to be rational and consistent in one's views than to seek fantastical delusions. Now such a position is unlikely to appeal to the mystic but if one wants to mature in one's mysticism one should give such nay-sayers a careful hearing, concede their good points and carefully critique the limitations of their point of view. Otherwise perhaps such rationalists are correct and such pursuits are bunk.

"It's heat plate grows rusty within few month.: Two years ago, I brought it and like it. I drink coffee in the morning, so only used it only once a day. Few month after I brought it, its heat plate started growing rusty. I continuely used it for additional six month when the 50% heat plate was rusted. I thought it was an incidence, so I threw it away and brought the same model again. Nine month late, 20% heat plate is rusted.... This time I don't think it is a incidence again.

"Run, Do Not Hide: While this book didn't scare me, I found it laughable and largely useless for the majority of twin-carrying women who like and trust their obgyns, believe that pain is generally to be avoided, and are actually comforted by the fact that institutions such as hospitals exist. Also, I found the book highly offensive in that it strongly suggested that miscarriage in twin pregnancies is caused by a mother's doubts about carrying twins. Gee, what a wonderful guilt trip to impose on a grieving mother...

"depressing and scary: I read this book while I was pregnant with my twin daughters and found it incredibly depressing and scary. It was filled with morbid quotes from parents who had a bad outcome, along the lines of, ""when not even one of the triplets lived, I went out and got drunk,"" and seemed to dwell on every possible problem and complication to the point that I was quite stressed and anxious when in fact, my twins were born naturally, five days before the predicted due date, had none of the complications this horrible book made me worry about, and were in excellent health. In fact, I so dislike the book that I go out of my way to warn expectant parents of twins to avoid it. In addition, the dietary advice is ridiculous and it's impossible for even a hearty eater to consume the massive amounts of food this writer claims are necessary to having a healthy baby. So, unless you like being scared, I recommend against buying this book.

"Wonderful Collection: I had enough of a balance on a gift card for one CD. After listening to samples of selections from Liona Boyd, Ana Vidovic, Susan Isbin and Martha Masters, I came across this one. I listed to the samples over and over and finally ordered it, largely because I liked the sounds of the duet. Once I received the CD and played the selections all the way through, I think I made the right choice. This is a superb collection. These two ladies brilliantly blend melodies and harmonies, with a little dissonance thrown in here and there.I've had it for a few months now and it's still as fresh as when I first listened to it. You know sometimes when you get a new CD, you're hyped up on it and listen to it over and over, but then after a while it takes its place amongst the rest of your collection? Not this one for me. Whenever I need to wind down, this is the one I listen to and I haven't grown tired of it yet.

Adaptec has some crazy requirements for a power supply (12V, 2.1A), and used to offer one that fit them through their store, but apparently no longer do! Without the adapter, this unit is only usable for items that draw almost no power through the USB or 1394 connection - which is a shame, because the Adaptec 1394 implementation was always the most stable on my machines. Look for one that includes an AC adapter or some other way of bringing power to the unit instead.

NP proves to the world, that they play what they want to and not what the public wants to hear. Their live shows sound very interesting complete with a fire-breathing bassist and crazy stage antics.

"Linen Chef Jacket: This chef coat is very, very large (I ordered a med.) if you are a ladies size 16 or larger this may fit you -- but the coat has no shaping whatsoever -- so you will look like a big marshmallow (mine is white) -- also, where the collar meets at the neck has a very large space -- which is not traditional and looks very odd. The fabric quality is OK, which for the price is not so great. Perhaps this was cut for men, but the buttons and fabric would make it too girly. This coat design needs to be amended and shaped and the overlap (where the buttons cross over) needs to be re-thought as the fabric hangs down and bunches under the coat -- so the bottom hem is not 'clean' -- it needs a button underneeth or something to stop that from happening.

"Gorgeous music gorgeously played: I will not usually recommend a mono CD unless there is no other version of the work in question or the performance is superlative. Well, there are many recent CDs filled with ""the antique music,"" but none bear up so well as the Amadeus reissue of the 1961 <Instrumental Music of 1600> (AMD 7007) as performed by the Concentus Musicus Wien under Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the man who was one of the pioneers of ""period instruments"" in recordings. Here we have 23 cuts of music from France (du Tertre, du Caurroy), England (Holborne, Morley, Tomkins, Cooper, Bevin), Germany (Sommer, Posch, Scheidt), and Italy (Cabrielli, Gumai, Massaino), all of which is available elsewhere and perhaps some of which is played as well and in better sound. I will deduct a rating-point, however, for its short running time of 46 minutes. But all in all, this is gorgeous music gorgeously played.

"If you read only 1 book about the death penalty, read this!: This well-written book examines virtually all arguments regarding the death penalty. In addition to exposing current practices, Just Revenge also puts the death penalty in an historical context. Its inevitable conclusion, as it demolishes every well-cherished but incorrect justification for the death penalty (with the exception of a clause in the 5th Amendment) , is that the only thing proponents have left on their side is indeed just revenge. Mark Costanzo's own opinion is clear virtually from the start, but he backs it up with fact after devastating fact. If you want to learn more about the death penalty, this is an excellent place to begin. It is also a useful reference book as it is chock-full of statistics and anecdotes.

Ms. Gibbons was gracious, of course, but she could not answer the obvious difficulties in this book. The chronology is confused, and while the book reaches for important issues, ie the need for a young girl to have a mother, the treatment of the characters is shallow. The longing is there, and it is expressed well, but ultimately, the miraculous ""healing"" of the mother and her immediate death after her restoration--undermine whatever strength was in the novel.The one character that the reader has no trouble believing is Pearl, the caring maternal housekeeper. She is a jewel of characterization, much needed and appreciated in this novel.

"Definitely not Prodigy's best material: Maybe it's because I've been listening to the energetic and inspired electronic music of german industrial/EBM for the past few years. Or perhaps it's just Prodigy did not put enough effort into this release. Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this single...Baby's Got A Temper just does not catch the attention of my ears. In ways it does mimic the style of a few of Prodigy's past songs with the break beats and repeating synth lines, but it just can't match the magic of their former hits like Breathe and Firestarter. The remixes of Baby's Got A Temper are not really that much to look forward to on this single either. Even die-hard Prodigy fans should find somewhere to listen to this single first before buying it. Hopefully Prodigy's upcoming album will incorporate some more inspired songs for redemption from this lackluster single.

"One of the Best Metal Albums of All Time!: The first song I heard on this album was ""Bounce,"" and to be quite honest, I wasn't impressed. But I saw the CD at Best Buy, and thought, ""Why not."" I must say it has not been something I've regretted. This is nu-metal years ahead of any other band you will find out there, with insightful underlying political protest all the way through. But if you want an album to just rock out to... well this is actually an amazing choice anyway. There is some amazing stuff here. Like ""Chop Suey!"" a deeply touching/disturbing song about the unpleasant topic of suicide and ""Toxicity"" a song about the terrible disorder in the world. With the split of Rage Against the Machine, there is little possible competition for System on their way to the nu-metal top.

"Good but doesn't top the first one: As much as I enjoyed System of A down's first effort, it took me a long time to get into this one. But I guess i'm like that with every new cd a band comes out with. Anyway. I think that on this cd Serj shows more of his vocal ability to go really high than down to a near death metal scream in prison song, but I was disapointed that the drummer, did not do any crazy drum solos as he did on the band's self-titled debut. All in all i really enjoyed this cd and I would highly recommend for anyone who is starting to get into metal or into System of a down. The single ""Chop Suey!"" is definitely one of the songs where the bands demonstrates the most musical talent in my opininon. Although the sound of the song is a bit more radio-friendly than the rest of the cd, it is still a great song. Another song with great talent is the song ""Toxicity"" which has proven to become my favorite on this multi-faceted album.

""Chop Suey!"" is also great, it's got interesting allusions to God and Jesus, ""Psycho"" is good headbanging fun (and warns you to stay away from cocaine too!), and ""Aerials"" is nice and meaningful.

Yes, you have to accept somewhat two-dimensional personalities. But if you get past that, you get a nicely shot, tense, supernatural crime saga with a couple of interesting characters. Most folks will have never heard of Constantine or Hellblazer, on which the movie is loosely based, but it's fine if you haven't. The movie is good enough on its own for an enjoyable night.

"Lamebrain to the hill.: Lamebrain film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film plus Peter Stormare and Tilda Swinton have great cameos that really should have been bigger roles. Weisz, Hounsou Stormare and Swinton give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Rachel Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does no know how to direct a movie.

"Overblown Mess: This is bad. Really. Perhaps it is one of those movies which can only be fully understood or enjoyed if familiar with the comic that originated it. It does not even have the redeeming quality of being a decent action film. Guilty of the worst capital sin of the kingdom of entertainment: boring, boring and boring. For that alone, it will burn in cinematic hell.

"Where is Mystery Science Theater 3000 when you really need it?: Extremely awful Keanu Reeves stinker that not only lives up to the word of mouth but surpasses it in spades. Keanu proves once and for all on how bad an actor he is with a groundbreaking bad performance and a script that helps him out a lot in proving that. Only his co-stars come out of this film with their heads held up high with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare but not even their great performances can salvage this disaster. This is fresh material for the show "" Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and I hope they can get a print of this movie and tear it apart for the garbage it really is.

"Weak, very weak.: Dumb Keanu Reeves horror epic that is not only the actors worse film by far but a bad film in it's own right. Keanu is just wrong for the role and the script is joke in many ways. Most of the performances are not very good. (Shia LaBeouf was horrible and made Keanu look like an Oscar winner by comparison) The only performance of merit is that of Rachel Weisz and she literally keeps you glued to your seat with her powerful and emotional performance. Unfortunately, while she gives her all, the rest of the movie is in self destruction mold all around her with bad special effects, very bad dialog and a story that makes no sense what so ever.I stand with the majority, Rachel Weisz is the only good thing about this film, so wait for Dvd to see this film and in the mean time rent Runaway Jury or the Shape of things. Two very good movies that compliment Weisz's performance unlike this one does.

"Should have read the reviews before I saw it.: Terrible adaptation of the great comic book ""Hellblazer"" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.

"Finally I can pre-order the DVD!: I haven't been able to get this movie out of my head. I love it, it was such a brilliant take on the comic book adaption. Sure, I was disappointed at first about the casting choice to play constantine, but it turned out so much better than I expected and I grew to love it. I can't wait for a sequel!Reeves did an outstanding job capturing the spirit of John Constantine, and Rachel Weisz gave her all. The two had such great chemistry and I am thankful they didn't overplay the relationship thing by not overfluffing the movie. It's a great flick you should consider adding this to your collection.Kudos to Francis Lawrence for doing such an outstanding job as a first time movie director.

"creepy cool: Constantine has accepted his fate and made peace with it. He knows that death and a hellish afterlife are imminent. Flawed and fatalistic, cigarette between his fingers, he plods along throwing himself into one horrific situation after another, in an effort to help a woman he doesn't even know. It's creepy and powerful. Angels, devils and friends. The guilty and innocent. Keanu Reeves is perfect in this role and it's a movie to watch again and again. Liked it a lot. Reminds me of Sandman Slim stories.

"Why did Warner Brothers release this garbage?: This movie is garbage, stay home and save your money. My friendsand I were trying to stay awake through the entire film, although I don't know why. Sleeping would have been a more productive use of our time, rather than wasting time trying to figure out this film. When the old tired plot finally starts to unravel, we didn't care what was going on. I felt that the actors are an insignificant part of this movie, they don't matter. In other words, this film is so bad, it doesn't matter who was in front of the camera, no one could save this trash. The film is very dark, shot like a low budget film, with a few special effects.My friends and I can honestly say that we did not like anything about this film.

"What the HELL were they thinking?: Horrible adaptation of the vertigo comic book is not only a smack in the face of the followers of the book with a flat out moronic screenplay that takes all the good out of the comic but also has the worse actor to play the title role of John Constantine. Keanu Reeves not only makes the role into a joke with his lack of talent but makes everyone around him look bad as well. The cinematography is ugly, making the movie a real eye sour and the special effects lack a certain feel to it. Out of the entire cast, only Rachel Weisz comes out with her dignity intact with a very good performance that the movie squanders in order to let Keanu act like a darker version of his NEO character towards the latter half of the film. They should have taken the material seriously and made a great horror movie out of it but instead, we have a children's movie that geared to Matrix heads.Avoid this film like the plague.

You get one of the worse movies ever made. Keanu Reeves performance in this film is so bad, it makes his Bill and Ted movies look Oscar worthy. The direction from first time Director Frances Lawrence is flat out horrible with lousy direction and murky cinematography and the script is so badly written that you are really surprise by what you are hearing from the actors' mouths from time to time. Of all the actors involved only Rachel Weisz and are able to come out of this horrible film with their dignity intact with good performance that this movie really did not deserved. Other than them, almost everybody involved should hang their heads in shame for making such a bad movie.

"Pretty bad: Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.

"Makes Hellboy look like a masterpiece.: Dimwitted supernatural thriller that is a major bore for the most part with a dimwitted performance by Keanu Reeves, who is miscast in the main role and a screenplay that is as stupid as it can be. A lot has been said about Rachel Weisz being the only good thing that this movie has to offer and I will agree with that assessment because she does make you care about what is going on with the movie while you are trying to figure out a way to care about the dumb story that is being told. Weisz's performance is much too rich and powerful for a movie like this and she gives you a reason to stick around while in essence there is no reason to even stay till the end. Hellboy was a masterpiece compared to this and that was marginal decent for what it was at the very best.For Weisz's rich and powerful performance, I give the movie two stars. If she were not in the movie, my rating would be in negative numbers. -0.

"Not even a B movie a Z minus movie: Truly a pathetic film.The only few minutes of the film that was interesting was the very beginning after this it raced downhill.The Demons and characters were all unbelievable except for the female lead. I can not fathom the audience for this film except for the blind, deaf and dumb. I have never been a fan of Keanu Reeves but some of his films have been exciting. He brought nothing to this nothing.

"Comment on CONSTANTINE: I did not like the movie as the dialogue was whispered and it was difficult to understand what was being said, and to make it even more objectionable, the audio level would overwhelm when the scene cut to an action event. The audio level had to be constantly adjusted and the picture was not very sharp even with a Hi-Def monitor. It is suggested Amazon get a limiting amplifier or one of the old CBS Audiomax units like TV broadcasters used in the 60's to prevent the commercials' audio levels from annoying the viewers. Run ALL movies through an audio processor and get this under control.Jim

"This was the worse.: Horrible can't describe this movie in a right light. This was the worse film I have seen in years and this should prove once and for all on how bad Keanu Reeves is as an actor because he's at his worse in this film. He's so bad that he has the uncanny ability to make you feel stupid once the movie is over, that's how bad he is. The script is a huge mess and most of it does not make sense what so ever and the picture is way too dark in certain areas of the film. Rachel Weisz is great in the movie but she's basically carrying Keanu on her shoulders during most of the film while he over acts in horrific ways and she is stranded with a story that really should have had a good rewrite before it became a shooting script. Other than her, the movie is just a huge help of crap that should not have been made.

"Rachel Weisz is great but the movie is a disaster.: Not very good horror action movie that has the right stuff but lacks a certain amount of credibility to mix.

I have to agree with what has been said about Rachel Weisz, who is the heart and soul of this movie and she does lift it over the mediocre script and funny dialog. Her performance is golden and worthy of a much better movie.See it for her alone but you will end up feeling sorry for her for being the only good thing about the whole movie.

He quickly learned that advice from others can be mistaken and the necessity of evaluating what others prescribed. He gives a good account of a prudent life, but does not spare himself, clearly declaring when he was at fault or mistaken.

"Classic, unadulterated Paul Kelly & the Coloured Girls.: This is where it all started for many Kelly fans. It's wonderful stuff--Paul's lyrics on this album are pure working class poetry. The musical style is unashamedly lusty-boy pub-band, unsynthesised (I remember when music was real....) and relentlessly cheerful. Every tune on this album is catchy, and even the dark ones are uplifting. ""Dumb Things"" was the anthem for pre-gen-X, post-baby-boom lost souls. Kelly has honed his lyrical ability since those early days, but his story telling has always been strong.Under the Sun is unmistakably Australian, more so than on later albums. This is particularly obvious on ""Forty Miles to Saturday Night"" and ""To Her Door"". When Kelly writes about things Australian, he gets it right. There is emotional truth in the detail here, and the music is damn good. Kelly deserves his status as an Australian working-class (anti-)hero. CB

"...: The music on this set is fine, as Ms Day always is. However it has a quirk I find distasteful. On the third cd is a hidden track, track 13 to be exact that throws all the songs out of sequence if you rip it. I wouldn't recommend buying this for that reason alone. All the songs are available on other cd's so it's no problem skipping over this one. It seems if they want to mess with people and keep it a secret until after the money is spent then my money will be spent elsewhere.

"Nice instight hidden in the pages: The book is not bad. The most valuable sections of this book include topics of Structure-Process-Outcome (sometimes), cognitive learning, values, culture, goals, working with tools, and communication. The diagrams and tables in this book are almost not helpful at all; sometimes you wonder if diagrams like figure 1-3 on page 23 is downright necessary to have there. I felt like parts four and five of the book really dragged on unnecessarily, especially the chapter on organizational engineering. It seemed as if the book completely broke down and lost it after page 300. I think that Hoemann had a lot of potential in this book when I first saw it, and I was let down. Another nice thing would be for him to drop the plethora of coined-terms. Overall, there is some really nice thoughts in here, but there is a lot of unnecessary things that you have to thumb through.

"Too much money for too few channels: This antenna may work for some people, but for me it was another regrettable purchase. The assembly is fairly easy, but the results proved a letdown. I bought the Terk in hopes it would work perfectly with the Samsung DTB-H260F set top box I am using to bring in free OTA digital and HD stations. But I tried two different positions with the Terk and its 10db amp was only able to bring in three or four local DT stations at best. Analog reception proved even worse. When I took off the Terk and replaced it with a coventionally-designed, less expensive indoor antenna with a 45db amp in those same positions, the difference in performance was amazing...I could get between 12 and 15 DT channels. In conclusion, my advice is to avoid the hype about unusual antenna design and go for maximum decibel amplification. It's that extra power that made the difference for me. Sorry Terk...

"touching: A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , is a very touching novel. It takes place in the 1920's and tells what life is like growing up back then , with all of the obstacles that come along the way. Francis is the main character of the book who grows up along with the trees in Brooklyn.She grows up in a poor family and struggles to fit in and find friends however, that does not bring her down. Francis is still a very happy and cheerful person regardless of what other people may try to tell her. She loves to read and since she doesn't have many friends, she feels and makes her books her friends. When Betty Smith wrote this book, she looked back on her life and the experiences she had, and put some of them in her book. It is written not only for teenagers or adults, but anyone who wants to read about the thrill of growing up. If you miss A Tree Grows In Brooklyn you are missing a truly great novel.

Francie also deals with the tradgedy of her fathers death. Not to mention almost being raped. This book also deals with a girl becoming a woman. A must read book!!!!!

"Fantastic reading: I have read "" A Tree Grows In Brooklyn"" over and over again.When things in my own life seem too difficult,I read about the life of Francie Nolan and realize I can overcome any problem with the same determination that Francie and her family had. All the characters were good,from the strong-willed mother,the weak dreamer of a father, to the loving but promiscuous aunt. Francie was my favorite character of all,she was able to overcome the adversity in her life through sheer dtermination and the gift of learning. She learned from everyone around her and the harsh enviroment in which she lived.

"It's not hype!: This book has so many pearls of wisdom. It's very simply written, so do not expect this to be a typical NYT bestseller like the one you read last week. I believe this book was written in the '40s, and although much of the vernacular in the book is obviously of a different period in time, it has a timeless and universal appeal. I haven't even finished it yet, but have already decided, enough with the library version, I want my own copy so that I can use the advice it offers later on in life. Don't miss this one, and make sure you tell your friends about it, so that they can come and thank you later, and you can say ""I told you so"".

"A (Diseased) Tree Grows in Brooklyn: I recently read this book for my English class at school. I have enjoyed every other book we have been required to read; however, I strongly disliked this book. From the first chapter I lost interest in the ornate, seemingly endless details. On several occasions I noted incorrect grammar in the book, and even misspellings! Never before have I seen such a poorly written book. I do not recommend this book. I would not call this book a classic.

"A Classic?: I honestly don't know how this novel has become a classic. As an avid reader I had to practically force myself to get through this book and only did so because my book club was reading it. I wasn't the only person in our club who was disappointed. It was a miserable story and pointless. It was a great discription of life in Brooklyn during that time period but Betty Smith never made me care about the characters enough to care about what happened to them. This novel needs more character development to be a classic. I only give it 2 stars instead of 1 because it really is a great description of life in Brooklyn.

"Well Worth Acquiring!: Pianist John Hicks has long been a master of the modern mainstream without necessarily blazing any new paths of his own. On this CD he is featured on a pair of solo numbers, a duet with flutist Elise Wood (a sensitive version of Duke Ellington's ""Star Crossed Lovers""), a trio rendition (with bassist Curtis Lundy and drummer Cecil Brooks III.) of ""Mood Swings,"" with a quintet (a blazing version of ""My Shining Hour"" that has both Bobby Watson and Vincent Herring on altos) and five selections with the full sextet. Four standards follow six obscurities (including Charles Mingus' ""Diane""). Hicks, who often shows off the influence of McCoy Tyner's voicings, has never recorded an uninspired record and this one is better than average for him. Due to the variety of moods, instrumental colors and settings, the music is continually interesting and well worth acquiring.

"How did Brian Mcknight and Russell Crowe get on this CD: I couldnt wait to hear this CD cause i love Kris Kristofferson and his work. many of the names on the CD were great and some great singers came out to do triButes to Kristofferson. Shooter Jenning's ""Silver Tongue Devil and I"" is amazing. Willie Nelson's ""The Legend"" is as great or if not better then the Highwaymen version. The version on ""Why Me"" is also a worthy tribute. The problem i had with the CD was when i heard Russell Crowe's ""Darby's Castle"" cause it was a horrible redition where Russell Crowe tries and fails at doing the talking blues that was done so well by Kristofferson and Dylan. Then i heard the awful Brian Mcknight atrocity ""Me and Bobby Magee"" which was just Mcknight turning a country and rock classic into his horrible R&B redition. I had never heard a bad version of ""Me and Bobby Magee"" until this CD. I don't know how those two got on this CD but fans of Kristofferson should be enraged.

On Volume 2, she sings wistfully of ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" as well sings coyly ""Nice Work If You Can Get It"" and ""I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm."" Also, ""Over the Rainbow"" and ""Blues in the Night"" are stand-outs.

The author failed to show me any reason to be afraid of these bodies.

"A necessary if unpleasant reading experience: Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's ""Pictorial Key"" is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the ""uninitiated"" astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary

I may just need to tweak it a little more. It has never failed to trigger when someone has entered the area, which is the important part. I don't know that I would hook it to a siren but I'm very happy with the system. Instructions that come with the unit are very good but where a little unclear about how to hook up the external devices to be trigged. I plan to add a light to be activialed in the warehouse for night. I did buy an extra sensor for the driveway and some of the false alerts there are casued by birds flying in front of the sensor.

Finally through them all out (Yep, tossed one paperback and two hardcopy) as I realized as I was re-reading them, that the somewhat graphic sex (Dominance and Submission, and Harem Girls, etc) didn't really add to the story but sure promoted things I just don't like. The March Upcountry series with David Weber had boys and girls, and talked about sex, but was what I consider more normal for SciFi, and was not graphic, did not promote ""alternative"" sex.

"Watch Out for Those Bones: Forensic pathologist Temp Brennan spends part of each year in North Carolina and part of it in Quebec -- investigating death. Usually her investigations find her examining bodies and bones of historical deaths or of recent deaths where normal means of pathological investigation aren't effective. Author Kathy Reichs clearly knows her pathology. Herself a practitioner, she makes her field exciting for the reader to learn about. In addition her character Temp Brennan finds herself in the midst of people who's deaths have been quite mysterious. Death Du Jour travels from uncovering the hundred year old remains of a nun who is believed to be a Saint to the sleaziness of a cult who might just be killing people as part of their worship. Temp Brennan isn't just a laboratory investigator. She is indeed one solid pathologist who is not particularly willing to let a case close without getting to the bottom of it.

I had not read much speculative fiction other than some Harry Turtledove and I have to say I loved it. Then I went out and bought 1633, it was another gem. Things skipped a bit with The Galileo Affair, just a little too much sermonizing. But this latest, The Ram Rebellion, just stinks. Most of the stories were written by obvious amateurs fascinated with sheep, cooking, agriculture and whatnot. Now those are all fine things, but I bought the other books to be entertained with action+fantasy+history, in that order, not history+agribusiness+feminism. I am going to read one more book in this series and if it does not improve I will swear it off for good.

"A Book I Actually Wanted To Read: This is a great book about a thirteen-year-old boy named Mark. Mark is hiking across the desert where he stumbles upon a mysterious light. As Mark touches it he ends up in a whole new world. Grass and plants are red and animals are different. Also there are new types of humans. Now Mark must use everything he knows to survive and to find the mysterious light to get back home.This book has a lot of action in it and it keeps you wandering the whole time. That is one of the reasons I like this book. The only thing I didn't like is the book just kind of stops at the end. It is a great book though. I can compare this book to a lot of books Will Hobbs writes because they both have a lot of action. I could also compare this book to any survival books because Mark has to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Will Hobbs or loves action and adventure!

"A Great Book: I was assigned to review this book in class for my literature final. I am not a big reader so I was upset about haveing to read. The day after I got the book I got sick and had to stay home from school. To pass the time I sat out in the sun and read the whole book in two hours. This book was exciting and although it was slow at first, when the story got going, I couldn't stop reading. The key character is Mark a young boy who is into hiking. His parents let him go on a hike in a desert and he promises to meet them at the other end of the desert. While Mark is setting up camp one night he sees a wierd blue light. He climes closer to it and falls into it. When Mark wakes up he is in a red jungle. He goes through a sieries of troubles such as quick sand and finding food before he finds other humans. Mark finds some great compainions and a great adventure!

"James Lee Burke-Dave Robichaeux series: This is a blanket review of all 17 books in this series, the first being The Neon Rain. JLB is the definitive of Mystery/Crime writers when he developed the character Dave Robichaeux, a Cajun Homicide detective who started his career in New Orleans and eventually semi retired in New Iberia, LA. The stories are strong, sensitive, moral and above that hypnotic in a sense where you are in the story literally (if your hooked on it). Highly recommended along with his other series of books.

"Sloppy research: Although Desjardins' book contains a number of interesting revelations, his arguments are often compromised by sloppy research. For example, his key claim that ""Little Round Top"" was not known by that name until ""years"" after the battle was proven false nearly a decade ago. Desjardin is especially weak when he tries to play photo-detective. He mentions with praise the research of photo historian William Frassanito, but doesn't seem to have actually read Frassanito's books very carefully. Desjardin's arguments also suffer from the obvious omission of pertinent, but contrary information

"This book is wild, wonderful, blatantly honest and necessary: If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have one book with me, I would choose this one. It angers me, saddens me, offends me, and elates me. But most of all it inspires me. Each time I read it I uncover something precious and unique. It never grows old. If you truly love all that is convenient and commercialized, if you revel in the gifts technology brings you, don't read it. It's too good for you. If you truly love and are capable of appreciating the serene beauty of the wilderness buy it, read it, then cry. For it's all gone. When you read, read beneath the text. Read deeply into the subtext of this book. It's all about surfaces. Abbey proves that we cannot truly see, experience or appreciate anything unless we can look below the surface as he did.

Anyone who spends time in pristine wilderness, redrock desert or not, will appreciate this read.

"An Elric novel written by Authors who grew up reading Elric: I have read every Elric novel. I own 500 kilos of fantasy paperbacks. This book brought me as much joy, inspiration and satisfaction as any book I have ever read. Elric was the first ""evil"" hero. Every fantasy writer has taken a peice of elric to produce their characters. Drizt Do'urden is a shadow of Elric. Raistlen is almost an exact copy of Elric. Darth vader's sinister life, dependence on technology/sorcery and eventual noble self sacrifice are in mimicry of Elric. In this book so many authors who wanted to write Elric stories, some who had made great fame and fortune copying Moorcock, were given licence to write as they pleased. Every short story in the book is its authors best work because as they write about their own dark heros in their own novels they are thinking about Elric. My highest praise: I want a sequel.. or two... or ten... a series published monthly untill I am old and grey.

However, the only reason I do own it was because they attached their videos on DVD. We like it (Wild & Loose) and Juicy Gothca Krazy are great songs but only in there video forms. If you are looking for those sames songs as released on video on CD you aren't going to find it.

"Boring: The problem with this book, is that you cannot argue for copyrights on one hand, and against them on the other. Either there is intellectual property or there is not. If there is not, then it is a government granted monopoly, and government granted monopolies can be shown to be less efficient then the market. As such, this means that copyrights would not do a better job at encouraging ingenuity. The thing is the book seems to talk about the philosophy of it a lot more then the reality of it.

I have been a big fan of Moby for quite some time now, but I have found myself skipping a song here or their on some of his other albums. This CD is one of those CD's you want to leave on repeat all day, and listen to it through and through. On this album Moby remixes a lot of old blues songs, and briliantly brings them to life. He takes electronic music to a whole new level with this album. If you don't own any Moby, start here.

"Moby Continues His Great Style: The first song I ever heard of Moby was his techno remix of James Bond. Since then I've been hooked on his music, and he certainly doesn't disapoint on this great album. One thing that Moby has, is a unique sound. He will never sound old, or his style of music will never be used by others, because no one could copy Moby. It isn't Rock, nor techno. it's something in between On this album, all the songs are strong, but in particular I think the song ""why does my heart feel so bad"" is the best. It pours out the most emotion without a doubt. It was used in the trailers of Black Hawk Down, and was used perfectly. Overall, if you are a fan of Moby, Buy this album!!

"The loudest stealth ever: Sadly this product performs admirably with supplying power but where it fails is its stealth. Check out OCZs forums for many complaints about it being quite loud. Apparently they've kind of messed with all their customers and created an extremely loud product that is difficult to return to most e-tailers.FYI some retailers have newer revisions of these units that are much quieter but the UPCs are exactly the same so good luck finding one.

However in the last month the handset started ""Channel Searching"" no matter how close I was to the base and how good the signal. Two days ago the handset went into channel search mode and literally has not stopped searching since.

"Satirical and funny...: I've just started studying an MBA in the U.S.(I am going through my second semester), and I saw this film a couple of weeks ago. The first ten minutes did not tell me anything good, since it seemed one of those low budget, ""C"" type, uninteresting comedies that invite you to switch channel.I am glad I didn't, because we eventually had a lot of fun with the dialogs and situations, a long discussion after the film was finished, and I saw lots of things that have to do with my management courses...Very recommendable, either to de-stress, or to realize that THAT (all the bad karma and nonsense by people who just want to control you and your life) is what you want to avoid, by all means.

"Trying...: The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling ""that would be great,"" stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again.

"Some of the funniest scenes, with an overall bland plot: I love this movie. It has so many individual scenes that are hilarious. The overall plot and story aren't the greatest, but I've found most people can over look this.This movie is rated R, and I think its one of the tamest R movies I've seen. There is brief nudity and a fair amount of swearing (mainly in rap music). However, the R rating may be for the best since I don't think anyone under the driving age will think this movie is all that funny. It's mainly work related and relationship comedy. I am thrilled to say there is no ""bodily fluid"" humor that has been in so many movies lately.The DVD features are almost nonexistant.

"That's greeeeat.: Rather than comment on the film, I'll comment in the disc itself. Worthwhile set of extra features, but it's not an action film so the widescreen doesn't add much.

It pokes fun at everything from commuting to office birthday parties to ""fast casual"" chain restaurants.

It could be that I tend to like movies that have some value or even a plot (even if it didn't have either, some HUMOR could have been good). I could have done without this movie, but at least now my friends will quit bugging me to watch it.Word of advice: I wouldn't watch it with kids or with older parents. Actually, I wouldn't watch it at all.

"Laughing at Ourselves: There are a lot of funny movies out there, but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes. ""Office Space"" fits this latter category, doing for the modern, post-1980 workplace what ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" did for the Arthurian legend. That is to say, ""Office Space"" has become a part of our common culture, with shared concepts like ""pieces of flair"" and ""Is this good for the COMPANY?"" being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us.Further, ""Office Space"", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits. They do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders. To see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of ""Office Space."" It's a classic.

"So real it hurt: The year was 1999. I was working as a customer service representative in an office that looked eerily like the one in this movie. You know, one of those utterly bland suburban campuses. Our company had just hired ""efficiency consultants"" to ""analyze"" the business. Then one day a bunch of people get laid off. While there, management introduced a new phone system for tracking how we spent our time. We actually had to enter a code to use the bathroom so they could know how much time we were there.I remember sitting in the movie theater, not sure whether I should laugh or cry. Now 5 years later I can definitely laugh. I love the bit about the TPS report memo and the red stapler. Lots of rough language, but otherwise a real gem.

"NOT just another space shooter: When I first began speculating about this game with friends way back in 98'. All I heard was it was gonna be another space shooter that could not rate up there with games like X-Wing or TIE fighters. Man, I still will never forget the looks on their faces when I showed them how the game ran and just overall was a masterpiece of graphics and gameplay for it's time anyway. So your saying, yeah well what's the story with this game? Well, you start out as a GTA pilot (Galactic Terran Alliance) fighting a 14 year war against the Vasudans. The AI is impressive as is the combat animations and cutscenes. All I can say to anyone considering buying this is to get it before it is no longer made considering it's age. Enjoy!

"Steinbeck is good but E.B. White is better: Steinbeck's book are often quite earthy and rough. I think he had a macho image he wanted to maintain in part. He was a good writer (Noble prize, Pulitzer) and ""Travels With Charley"" is a wonderful book. It is not in this collection however. I find it difficult to swallow his profanity and it is never necessary (read Dickens for instance). In comparison, E.B. White had a gracious side to his writing, a wonderful subtle sense of humor and a beauty of economy with the English language. I like them both but prefer White. I mention the two together because they were both writing at the same time. They were both perfectionists and both hated to be in the public spotlight.

"What started out to be a beautiful movie....thrown in the trash!: This was recommended to be a wonderful movie, not to be missed, in our local small town paper.Indeed it started out to be just that, even with viewing it in-between the English subtitles (German made, German language) Magnificent scenes of Africa, and beautiful people all through out. Then, right in the middle, and totally unnecessary by all standards, very graphic sex scenes between 2 of the characters. I could not believe it! It ruined what could have been a totally beautiful movie in scenery and story. I was so angry I immediately threw it in the biggest trash can I could find. I was so angry I didn't want to talk about it, let alone give time to write a review, until now. Enough said, don't waste time or money on this movie.

"Good book, obnoxious author: The Oregon Trail is an undeniable classic -- although overrated compared to other books written about the same time about the same subject. Parkman is a priggish, Boston snob who complains his way across the West. He despises the pioneers crossing the plains and has no interest in them -- a startling lack of consciousness for a historian. The Indians and the mountain men fare little better.

"Hardly the Oregon Trail: This book was a disappointment to me and I should have researched it more before purchasing it. It was my hope to read about the settlers moving West on the old Oregon Trail but this book had nothing to do with that. Instead, it was an account of Parkman's experiences as he traveled in some of the Western areas of the U.S. (Wyoming area, Black Hills, etc.) Much of his time was spent with the various Indian tribes as he befriended them and learned much of their culture. He also spent a great deal of time hunting. My real problem with his story is that it was so repetitive. Many of the accounts were similar and it seemed like we were going over and over the same thing. I read almost every thing I can find on Western adventure and exploration but this one is sure not on the top of my list.

"Attention to Detail: The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise ""who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?"" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx ""Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?"" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw.

Behavioral science just had not developed to the point it has today, so he had no way of knowing that his basic assumptions about some things he viewed as givens were, in fact, not given at all. In the end, trying to make the subject of religion something that one can put to the test of ""logic"" is an exercise in futility. That's why it's called faith.

"Merely the same things rehashed: I recieved this book as a gift from someone I thought to be an open-minded, good person. This book has nothing new in it. It is worthless. It is just another example of a poor deluded SOB trying to convince himself that he really likes the cage he was tricked into entering.This book is prosylazation. Prosylatizers, I have found, try to convert people because they are insecure about their faith, and think that by converting the world they will be secure in their faith. The truly faithful person does not prosylatize, for if one is secure in one's faith, why preach? If I could give this book a NEGATIVE FIVE, I would.

"Quality works in poor quality packaging: For the last week I have been like a little child waiting for a birthday present to come in the mail. I have joyfully anticipated receiving this boxed set of C.S. Lewis treasures. At last, it came today. What a disappointment! If the covers of these books last through more than one reading, I will be surprised. The covers are beautiful, but the quality is poor, and certainly not worth the $47.90 I paid for this set. I was looking forward to something that would last for years to come. Oh well, I won't be sending the set back, because I'm anxious to read these incredible works (the first books I will have read in several years). If this review was about C.S. Lewis, it would be five stars. But, this review is about the shoddy quality of this set, and hence the single star review. Buyer beware.

"Not worthy of One Star. If the Academy gave out Oscars for: Worst movie, worst acting, and worst script, this would win hands down. When it comes to lame, witless and downright stupid movies, Ben Stiller is on quite a roll. If you are not a teenaged boy, I recommend staying away from this one.Dodgeball fancies itself as a parody of the typical sports movie, don't fall for it. The non-stop toilet humor is lame and predictable and it's a wonder that this movie can garner such rave reviews from so many people.In my humble opinion, if you have an IQ greater than 12, don't bother with Dodgeball. Personally, I'd sooner watch a marathon of Paulie Shore and Carrot Top movies before sitting thru Dodgeball again, and that my friends, is saying something.

"Not Bad: This movie was really silly, but I thought it was quite watchable. I was impressed actually. I wouldn't mind watching it again. Usually I don't like Ben Stiller movies, but I laughed at some of the stuff he did in this one. I guess it may be because I respect antagonists more than protagonists.The plot in this movie doesn't matter much. No one cares about it. This movie is for nothing but cheap laughs. Fortunately the cheap laughs aren't limited to endless shots of people getting hit in the groin. There's a whole variety of goofy humor. My favorite part is the black and white short film on Dodgeball they watch.Sometimes the humor gets a bit silly though. There's a guy who walks around in the film dressed as a pirate for no reason at all. I thought the whole pirate thing was the worst part of the movie. Still, it wasn't enough to tarnish the entire work.I'd recommend checking this out for a rental. Laugh at some parts and not at others. Go with the flow.

Sometimes he uses the hammer, sometimes he just pounds them with his hand. The hammer isn't that hard, so when he does decide to hammer Dad's head, it doesn't hurt that much :-) If your child is less than 1, it will take a few days playing with the toy before he/she masters it and pounds the balls with confidence (they LEARN the toy).

"cutting edge: Got these bits a couple of weeks ago to replace a 20+ year old Craftsman set. The first thing I noticed was the heft of the assortment; same number of bits as the Craftsman, but considerably heavier. Have mainly used a couple of the larger ones on a cast iron grill; they chewed through like it was pine. Have used some of the smaller bits to drill out rusted bolts. You only need to watch the metal filings pile up to know they're doing their job. Haven't used any on wood; seems like overkill and my older ones do fine for those. I only wish the storage box had a more positive lock mechanism. But I do like its bright size markings (sure beats stamped metal, which I can never read in weak light).

"lazy publisher: The edition of ""Jude the Obscure"" that I believe you're seeing on this page -- the Signet paperback, with the two horses on the cover -- first came out in '61 and hasn't been touched since then (except to add a bibliography in 1980). There is a helpful 11-page afterword by Al Alvarez, but that's it. Signet has just been reissuing and reissuing the same thing for over four decades.With the Signet, though, there are no footnotes; you're just getting the bare text. That means that you'll have zero help with Hardy's rustic or ecclesiastical terms, not to mention the abundant Latin.In short, get this one:Jude the Obscure (Oxford World's Classic), in which said defect is remedied. And unlike the Signet, in which the text has adjusted to reflect modern spelling and pronunciation, the Oxford's World's Classics is Hardy's original text as he saw it published.

"Not an easy read: I didn't enjoy reading this one. I know Hardy isn't the most cheery writer, but this was beyond just depressing -- it was boring. About halfway through, I was tempted to just skip the rest but I trudged on to the bitter end.This may have been scandalous when it was published, but why couldn't Hardy have done a better job with the ending? The almost Dickensian sequence of hard-to-swallow tragedies was too contrived for my taste. Was Hardy afraid of writing a happy ending for this unconventional pair, or did he want to display the worst-case effects of a rigid social code of behavior? Either way, it all became pretty unbelievable.From a historical point of view, as a jumping-off point for a discussion of the social constraints and morals of the period, Jude is a success; it certainly seems to have set off some fireworks when it was first published. As casual reading, I can't recommend it.

After shopping around, and seeing the price and reviews for this cable, I bought it, and in all honesty, this cable is much worse than even my component cables. I tried a few different movies, and a few different games, all to no avail. Characters in my games are choppy, and pixelated, and all of the movies, even in HD quality are blurry.

Yet, the transfer onto DVD is the worst I've even seen, the opening titles are blurry, the picture fuzzy. One review questioned that it may have came from the master VHS. I would not even go that far, it's a very poor copy, as for the sound, if you have 5.1 surround, you'll hear music and the voices coming from all directions.

"A Truly Beautiful Film!: When I was about four or five years old I loved to watch The Last Unicorn. Spotting it at Blockbuster, I decided to rent it, wondering how I would see it now.I was worried when I saw that the animation was Rankin/Bass, but in the end I found it to be a visual confection.Some of the characters do look a little cheesy, but most of the time the animation dazzled me. In particular Mommy Fortuna's tree stump hat is very cool, forestscapes are ethereal, and I love Molly's BIG brown eyes.My favorite scene is the meeting of Molly and the Unicorn...The woman is angered that the Unicorn came to her at a low point in her life rather than when she was ""new and innocent."" After that schpiel Molly embraces her and whispers, ""I forgive you.""To my mind, this is one of those works like The Little Prince or The Mouse and His Child that is meant for chidren but is sincere enough to captivate adults as well. Well done.

"Possibly the worst DVD transfer I've ever seen: First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse.

And why, why, why would they dare to include Elvis's horrendous live version of ""Polk Salad Annie"" and omit a classic like ""One Night""? It is for that glaring omission and that glaringly bad inclusion that I give this collection a rating of 4 rather than 5. Hey, I love Elvis Presley's music as much as anyone but he had no business recording ""Polk Salad Annie."" There's only one version of that song that should ever be heard and that's the original by the song's writer, Tony Joe White.

"A book for the ages: I mistakenly checked this book out of the library when I was in 4th grade (1964), thinking it was going to be about knights (""The Silver Sword""). Imagine my surprise when, upon reading the first page, I discovered it was about a young boy (my age) separated from his family during WWII. Yet, even that first page sucked me in. I was not an avid, or even a good reader at that age, but I couldn't put it down, and finished the book in two days. I proceeded to check it out at least once a year until I could no longer find it in libraries. It was probably the single biggest reason I learned to love reading. My son is now in 4th grade, and I logged on to see if I could find it, and will make sure it becomes a part of his life as well.

"Cute story with difficult vocabulary for kids: This book, set in Paris in late December follows a hobo named Armand, who's gruff on the outside, but reveals his inner warmth when he finds a newly homeless family living under ""his"" bridge. While this book does have many good points, this isn't a book I would recommend. The story would be very entertaining to a fifth grader but the vocabulary skills and difficulty understanding Paris or gypsies would frustrate a reader in this age group. A sixth grader, however, would more easily comprehend the vocabulary (I admit that I didn't know many of the words and had to guess at their meaning in context--and I don't consider my vocabulary skills poor by any means) and cultural situations but they would be bored by the simplistic story. In all, I would not recommend it not because it is a bad book, but because I think there are better choices out there.

"Absolutely the BEST: I have worn NARS Sunset Strip lip gloss for over 8 years and still continue to get compliments on the color. I have tried all the other major brands, Dior, La Prairie, Laura Mercier and Bobby Brown to name a few and nothing begins to compare. The color saturation is perfect and the formula is great without being too sticky. Many brands do not stay put, but the NARS is always there. I think the one major difference is that I always use a lip pencil first,, this helps to intensify the color and hold the gloss on the lip. Unfortunately I have been informed that they are discontinuing this color, but they have a new one called wonder that looks similar. Anyway, regardless of the color, I highly recommend NARS lipgloss.

Then I read this sequel and had to admit that it was likely the worst book I'd ever encountered. I didn't laugh once and literally had to force myself through it with several lapses between readings. Odin and Thor bored me senseless. I can now understand why there's been no third addition to the series. Time wasted on this could have been much better spent working on yet another HHG novel.

An explosion at Heathrow is called by the press an Act of God, and it turns out to be more than tabloid hyberbole, as Dirk Gently soon discovers.The feel of the novel is reminiscient of Thorne Smith's 'The Night Life of the Gods'. But although Adam's style is always enjoyable, the novel seems a little thin; all wit and little substance. Given Adams notorious bouts with writer's block maybe his publishers were unwilling to wait for it to be properly polished.

Buy the last album from Neil Young, GreatestHits it has better songs like his best, Down by the River, andthe great grunge, Hey Hey, My My. This is a waste of money.

"Lost in stereotypes: A decent book that could have been great, Homes's novel came off underbaked. Too many implausible plot lines that are hastily tossed in, incomplete, cookie-cutter characters, and a seeming desire on the part of the author to recreate the Los Angeles of ""L.A. Story"" sabotage an otherwise compelling story of a man who is trying to find his life again.Were this story focused on its characters more and their actual issues instead of attempting to impress readers with the flash and bang of its irrelevant events, this would have been a much more interesting book. Even the book's title suggests that Homes did not have a clear grasp on the point of this novel, and she spends 384 pages wandering around the desert trying to find it.

"If you like reading for the sake of reading...: Ultimately, this book is frustrating. It drones on like our own mundane lives, except the characters in the book are unbelievable. Everyone is an exaggeration. Too rich, too full of themselves, too over the top, too self serving.The conversations are all meaningless, except maybe the one where Richard's son tells him how he feels about their relationship.Even the ending of the book is unresolved and open ended.If you like reading for the sake of reading, I recommend it.

Superb directing, the atmosphere was just fantastic. Melissa George really showed her acting potential here, although I only have one other movie to compare to. And I'm like, who are these other actors? Surely one of them is going to completely bring the movie down in some way. Absolutely not. Solid acting all around.

"Poorly researched, this book is a must-NOT Read.: No one is perfect but a non-fiction is no use if you cannot trust the accuracy of the information in it. In Mistresses of Mayhem, Ms. Hornberger makes mistakes so blatant that it calls the whole book into question. One wonders if she did any research at all or just read up on the criminals on the Court Tv Website. She misnames Countess Elizabeth Bathory (the so-called female Dracula) as Bathroy. (No it is not a typo. It is spelled that way all through the book.) In the famous Diane Downs case already well documented by Ann Rule in Small Sacrifices and made into a tv movie seen by many, she misidentifies the daughter who died as Christie who might be surprised by this since Christie not only survived but testified against her mother. (Cheryl is the daughter who died but Hornberger describes Cheryl as testifying at the trial.) Simple proofreading could have corrected these mistakes. Good research would have made proofreading and this review unnecessary.

You will be up at night trying to find out who is sleeping with whom and killing whom next...The amount of sex in the book (without too much graphic detail) is numbing afterwards. It's almost as mundane as brushing one's teeth, after reading hundreds of pages on the role that sex plays in politics, weath, class, manipulation, etc.A harlequin story.Unbelievable society that Tudor was.So glad that women have it much better these days.The PILL did change history!

"Couldn't put it down!: I bought this book as an assignment for my moms' book club. I could NOT put it down! If my history books had been this interesting in high school, I probably would have considered majoring in history in college! Gregory's writing is absolutely delicious. She enhances the historical facts with dialogue and really gives you a sense of how these characters lived and interacted. Now I am completely fascinated by historical novels. Another recommendation from my book club is Abundance, about Marie Antoinette. (Even if you don't read it, please know that Marie is NOT the one who said ""Let them eat cake!"" That infamous quote was actually uttered by a man and incorrectly attributed to her. She actually loved the French people.) Anyway, this novel is much better than the movie ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" which I did see, so if you saw the movie you should still read this book to really get the details of the story!

"Scandle, sex, and fun: I never really was all that interested in the whole Henry VIII thing but I was given this book and just started reading the first couple of pages. It really has a way of engaging you from the start. In the beginning Mary is only a little girl involved in this larger than life role she has to play. You follow her along with her exciting life, and just when things start to cool off for her, you become fixed on her sister. I loved reading how nasty the author made her. I know there are legends of how Ann really was a royal pain. The author did a good job playing it up. It really is quite long over 650 pages, but you wouldn't know it, I read it in 6 days. Its really a page turner. It really only portrays Ann, and Mary in depth, and I liked that. I also liked how the author depicts an aging, baby of a king who likes to get his own way. In the end the author does an amazing job wrapping up the looses ends to the already known facts making this history/fiction story a great read.

"Not worth the time: First let me say that the purchasing end of this exchange was excellent. The book reached me promptly and was in fine condition physically. If only the writing were at least half as fine. The conversations sounded 20th century, not remotely 16th century. Nor did they sound like genuine exchanges among the Boleyn siblings but instead like devices to let the reader know explicitly what was going on in the palaces and historically. The author's choice of starting with a wholly naive narrator (Mary in her early teens) and increasing her knowledge and perceptiveness was not unwise in itself, but was clulmsy in execution. She seems altogether too dense for too long, and even after she's much more worldly still frequently demonstrates her ""cotton head"". There's no denying that the Tudor era was racy and dangerous. If this is the only book at hand on that subject, grab it and skim.

This was the first book I've read about Henry VIII and its inspired me to want to know everything I can about that time. Now I own over 30 books about Tudor history. I want to read everything I can get my hands on, and I never bore of it. And to think I owe it all to this book! It's from Mary Boleyn's point of view. You will see her challanges as well as Anne and the rest of their family. You will feel like your right there at court with them. It's an exciting and fearful time at the court of Henry VIII. It is also very accurate and I highly recommend it. Its one of Phillippa Greggory's better books. I've read all her books and this one is by far her best work. You will fall in love with the Tudor era if your not already.

"History Brought to Life: This book, first and foremost, brings to life the pure beauty of Britain; the old houses, wildlife and its rather bizarre history and has made me very proud of where I come from.The Other Boleyn Girl is extremely readable and tells of the rise and fall of the Boleyn family. I have never been much of a person for history but this book certainly interested me and went beyond anything I could have learnt in history class.I recommend this book without really saying why (for fear of ruining parts) but coming from a history know nothing I say it is definitely worth a read if you want to know about the greed of one man and the unstoppable ambition of one tragic family.

"A novel for the intellectually challenged: Anyone who treasures good historical fiction will, after reading--or trying to read--THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL--see at once that they stumbled upon what we once called a ""dime novel""-that pejorative characterizing hack writing, which in our time is seen most often in historical romances-novels peopled with superficial modern characters costumed in period dress. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is such a novel. In our time of computers, the internet and blogs, the dime novel has been given new life through heavy promotion and phony critiques. It's a world where lies flourish, and publications such as ""Publishers Weekly"" with their fatuous critiques, become co-conspirators in this deception.

"""Other Boleyn Girl"" a future Lifetime movie for certain: The hallmarks are all there--the air of virtue and innocence, the first love quickly disillusioned, jealousy, backbiting, a second romance that proves to be the reason for living--yes, we will someday see some actress playing Mary Boleyn on the Lifetime channel in ""The Other Boleyn Girl."" That's all this novel is fit for. Mary Boleyn is the most bovine ""heroine"" I've ever encountered, and Philippa Gregory's writing never gets above the Weepie of the Week level. The Boleyns are a fascinating subject for fiction; they aren't served well or made interesting by Gregory's book...

"One of the best books I have ever read!: This book is a wonderfully and thrillingly written account of the machinations of the Boleyn-family to get close to the throne at the times of Henry VIII. Mary Boleyn is ordered by her family to be at King Henry's command whatever his wishes and whims. She obeys her family, since she is barely 13 when first presented to the king. She succeeds in keeping him at her side for a while, until his eyes begin to wander again and he seeks fulfilment (in every way) elsewhere. All of a sudden she is commanded to stand back and let her sister Anne bathe in the king's glory. In my opionion Mary was quite helpless, whereas her sister Anne is portrayed as a scheming whore. The author has a fabulous way with words and if you are interested in English history written at a wonderful pace as well as a thrilling account(in other words: you will probably be utterly, competely, totally unable to put this book down, once you have started) this is a book you simply cannot miss!

Different times during the movie the background would change to blue and then ghosts would appear in red.

"Clear and concise, but requires supplementation: Griffiths' QM text provides excellent problems and a coherent, though somewhat cryptic, development of the theory. He has a conversational style (also evident in his EM text) that elucidates many of the hard-to-visualize concepts in QM. However, he relies on the use of many specialized techniques to solve problems. If the student is unfamiliar with the mathematical tricks involved, it leads to frustration. I recommend Griffiths' text as the main book in a QM course only if it is supplemented with additional hints (from the professor) on the problems, or with an additional text such as Shankar's or the Eisberg and Resnick work.

"Not just for breast feeding moms :-): Three words...BUY A BOPPY! Its not just for breastfeeding moms, though I can definately see how it would be a great asset for those who choose to breastfeed.I've used it during feedings, to take some strain off my arm (because baby can get heavy to hold in an upright position that is best for bottle feeding.) I've also used it to prop my baby up in a sitting position and she loves it! She looks so comfortable, I almost wish they made adult size boppys :-) I have also put it around my waist (and yes, it does bring back prego memories!) and layed the baby in it so she can snuggle close to me while my hands are free to do other things (read, change the channel, etc.) A great buy for every parent!

"Golding at his Greatest: Golding certainly seems to root out the very psychology that lays behind the rudimentary world of the male youth. In magnificently eloquent prose and a deeply engrossing story to boot, Lord of the Flies has deservedly been dubbed a modern classic.

"Authority: I believe that the author's purpose in the ""The Lord of the Flies"" was to show that without laws, there would be chaos in the world. To show that authority is trully needed in the world . I agree one hundred percent with this message because there is a need for consequences for people who refuse to listen to authority. The literary element that Golding handled the best was symbolism. For example, the conch was a symbol of authority and power. When the conch was broken , there was no authority , but complete chaos. This book is believeable because it is possible to get stranded on an island and it is possible for people to become mean and spiteful. The only bad thing about the book was some of the words were hard to understand. If I had written the book.

"An unbelievable waste of time.: As a response to one of the reviews that speaks quite highly of this novel, I would like to say that despite my understanding and comprehension of the book, I still found it entirely dull, boring, and a waste of my time. Since it was required of me to read this book in school, I was forced to make my way through each dragging chapter, but I would have never on my own time, and it's not because I didn't understand the book that I feel this way about it. My class discussed quite thouroughly about the book's symbolism, which was Golding's intention to start out with. Despite its hidden meanings, the novel still remains absolutely ridiculous in the sense that these young British boys turn completely salvage and kill their fellow islanders. If the book was looked at through a totally symbolic perspective, it would make more sense, but in order to understand its symbolism, one still has to read it, and it is really not worth it.

"Thumbs down: God this was terrible.A group of children are marooned on a deserted island and must survive on their own. We see the rise and fall of their society as order is achieved; power corrupts the strongest of the group and the weakest members are dismissed or destroyed and finally chaos rules.Despite my dislike of this book, I'll admit it is a very true commentary on society. The powerful abuse those weaker than them; how quickly rules become obsolete when they become inconvenient; the set roles of people in society (the chubby guy with glasses can never be as powerful as the cool, good-looking guy).If you are not being forced to read this for school, please don't do it! The Simpsons parody of it is also a good thing to watch. At least in a cartoon it is entertaining, with just as much commentary on society as the original.

I believe everyone does something that is evil. Although, some people have it in them more than others. I think the author used a lot of description which made it really boring. He also used too much violence, which in my opinion, only made it worse. I think this can happen to anyone who is in a plane crash. Being in this situatuion can get your mind crazy and make you do weird things, like the boys did. If it was me who wrote the book, I would use less description becuase is made it boring. I would also make it less vioent.

"Innate Savagery: Even though it's been years since I first encountered this novel, I still vividly recall the brave leadership of Ralph, the understanding innocence of Piggy, the thrill of the hunt, the smell of the pigs blood, and the intense primitive nature that takes dominion over the boys. The exploration of the various social interactions and the influence human nature has on them is intriguing and well delineated. However, the internal savagery that slowly and universally reveals itself amongst the characters proves to be the trues force which holds this novel high in my regard. Truly captivating and dangerously luring!

"A brilliant achievement. Symbolism beyond comparison.: This is my favorite book yet (and by the way, I've read quite a few.) Not only is the symbolism masterful, but the book is thoroughly interesting and captivating as well. I am shocked at some of the criticisms of this work of such epic proportions. I honestly can't figure how anyone could find fault with it. I understand that it's not the most enjoyable of experiences to ""read books for school,"" but this one is not one of the ""boring"" kind. The book is beautifully written and Golding's use of metaphor, allegory, and personification is consummate. Golding pulls all he can into this book, details from all walks of life. The book is incredible, as there is a vibrantly suspenseful surface story with ingenious characters and plot, as well as richly deep undertones of life and the depths of human heart and consciousness. All you have to do is read it.

"A fairly simple story with deep meaning: LOTF is a short and simple novel with a deep subject matter. Golding tries to convey his beliefs in the innate evil in individual humanity through a story wrought with simplicity.Golding does a great job in developing the characters of LOTF. The characters (unlike the 90's movie) are quite believable. Each of the main characters have their own personality and are utilized by Golding to symbolize his ideas.Golding uses a lot of imagery and symbolism, but he does this in a manner that is easy to understand. His writing style is simple and clear and without all of the complex language that can bog down a good novel. This story flows at a nice pace and never seems to ""drag on"".I enjoyed this novel. Underneath the symbolism there was a fast-moving, suspenseful story. And Golding did a good job in making the reader of this novel contemplate the nature of man and society. It's well worth the read.

"No wonder they call it the Lord of the Flies this book stunk: My favorite chapter in this book would definitely be the first chapter when the kids are introduced on the island. There was this one kid that everyone had called piggy. To me that is the funniest thing in the world. I don't know why but the humiliation of another kid is extremely hilarious. It may seem cruel but to me it's funny. I would have to say that this book was definitely for the older more mature kids, like high school kids. All in all I would have to say that even with the kid getting humiliated I dislike this book with a passion it is way to boring and just when you think it's going to get good the book disappoints you and I don't think that is a very good book for the serious reader

"a conventional view of mankind: this book exists to support the author's opinion that man is brutish and destructive.this was written well before clinical studies of violance, child abuse, the effects of peer pressure, etc. it reflects the basic christain view that man is vile.itis obvious that golding never considers that by the time any of these boys has spent time in their families and then in the prep school, any natural impulse has been thoroughly ground out bysocial standards. these boys are as affected by all they psychological influences as adults, with fewer methods to deal with them.of course they revert to so-called savagery--it's what they experienced at their school. of course there are no intelligent responses, we aren't trained to use intelligent response.the book is a polemic of the conservative christian--man is vile and must be controlled or he will become a savage.nurture has no place.i find it a completely annoying book, presenting an unrealistic result.

"May be a classic...but not as good as people think: I was required to read this book for school in my Honors English Class(9th grade), I found it very hard to follow and too symbolic. This is the book of dreams for any English teacher who loves to get their students to read between the lines. Personally, I enjoy a book that is a challenging read, but in this book, every little detail meant something ""deeper"" and it gave me a headache trying to interpret the aspect of society the detail was trying to depict. I understood the book, but, it was not enjoyable for me and if it were not a required reading, I would not have read the book otherwise. But, if you like books to give you a headache, then this is perfect for you.

"Lord of the Flies was creative, but lost our attention.: We think that the book, Lord of the Flies, was just 'ok'. It was an intense way of looking at a goodlife. We believe that the message of the novel was always have hope. We thought it could have ended better, but it pulled it all together well. Although we were bored at times, we liked the way Golding had items symbolize ideas. The book was different then ones we have read in the past, therefore, it broadened our views of good versus evil.

"A great book on so many levels: I first read this book at a young age. I enjoyed it very greatly then. Not as an allagory for anything or as anything of that sort but as a story of adventure and survival. Recently I have read it with my english class and explored the symbolism and allegories. I think that the lord of the flies is a very strong book with a strong message that can be understood at many levels and I think that this is a book that ever family that enjoys reading should own. The Lord of the Flies can be enjoyed and reread by people of all ages and spending an hour to read up on the symbolism in this book is well worth it as it enriches the story alot and provides a whole new meaning to the book. 5/5 for a great read for all ages.

"Novel review of the Lord of the Flies: The Lord of the Flies by William Golding wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. I thought that the idea of the book was very good and the theme was well thought out, but i don't think it was well written. Some parts could have been better, but it was interesting. Somethings I disliked were that there were only boys on the island and no girls. If there were girls I think the story would have been different. I also didn't like how Piggy died. I think the book would have had a better ending if Piggy stayed alive.Some things that i liked about the book were most of it was realistic. The schoolboys made rules for themselves, and there became two sides. I liked how the characters were described and how the meanings of their names mathed their actual names.

"Thought-provoking, creepy, depressing, and intuitive: I read this book two years ago for a grade 10 English class, and have not had the chance to reread it, but I do remember it well. The premise is not especially exciting initially, but it becomes a living parable of terror.I find it interesting that the author used boys as his subjects rather than little girls, or both. But would this have changed the outcome? That is something you must decide for yourself. Also, when finally ""saved"", the naval officer is confused as to what the boys are doing exactly, and yet Ralph knows exactly. Perhaps children are not as intellectually inferior as we are assumed to be.Though chilling, I highly recommend this book, as it gives a startling clear view of broken society. It's pessimistic, but perhaps, all too realistic.

"the what ol' days?: I cannot say enough about this book. There is so much depth in it and so much ot think about. There's more than just an innocence lost thing in it -like the choir leader, Jack, becoming the most evil on the island. I think Golding meant to imply that innocence is an illusion, as shallow as the choir boys' outfits. Being a substitute teacher for both high school and middle school, I would vouch Golding's implications hold true even for kids who aren't lost on desserted islands. Ultimately, the island signifies a pre-adolescent's experience, as being cut off from the world while admist a wild sway of new emotions. I'm glad this book exists, because peopel need access to eloquent articulation of youth's experiences.

"They cut the extras: I dunno about the stand-alone Blu Ray, but the DVD of ""Otis"" has a ton of great extras (commentary, deleted/alternate scenes/ending, featurette, trailers, etc.). This version, however, has no extras whatsoever. I thought the point of Blu Ray was being able to jam more on the disc while maintaining superior picture quality.On the plus side, ""Dr. Giggles"" has never looked better, and this seems to be the only Blu Ray release of that film. Though it's weird that they've paired it with a completely unrelated movie made nearly 20 years later.If you're only interested in the films themselves, you can't beat the price. But the lack of extras is irksome.

"Extremely poor continuation: I am a big Jane Austen's fan, and I love to read the continuations and sequels. However, I had trouble finishing this book. The break in the writing between Austen's original text and the addition is glaring. The style changes, the characters change, the plot leaps wildly. It's almost like two books -- the author shouldn't have bothered keeping the original text. She probably would have done better rewritting it to fit her own style. I highly recommend reading the other Sanditon continuation by Anne Telscombe instead. It does a seamless job of continuing and the characters stay in character.

"Not for kids under 12 years old: While the finished product--a working phone with see-through cover and flashing lights--is great, this toy is definitely not easy to assemble. It took a bright 9-year-old, her 40-year-old aunt, and the child's grandfather (well-versed in electronics) two hours or more to finally get all the pieces in place! The parts seem to be well made and the phone really *does* work, but the directions are very difficult to understand and there was no explanation whatsoever of how a phone works. In short, what was supposed to be a fun ""learning experience"" turned out to be an exercise in frustration. This kit is probably best suited for teenagers or adults who already have some background in electronics.

"Very concerned about The Einstein Syndrome: First of all, I am quite offended by this author. I am a licensed speech-language pathologist with 30 years of experience in the public school system. I am currently working as a special education coordinator in (heaven forbid) a public school system. I read about children and their issues/concerns/characteristics continuously. This book was recommended by a parent and I was very excited to read it. I was not prepared for the assault on speech-language pathologists and others in the public schools of America. I truly wish the author would do a more thorough investigation of our credentials and our job performances. We are not in the business of ""creating business"". Believe me, we have plenty to keep us busy.

"The academic types love it.: I guess it makes one feel intellectually in touch if he can praise this book. I guess I will never make it to that level, because I think this is one terrible book. I read approximately 100 pages on the traits of Fox Edwards, therefore, I was a little upset when I found out it was for no reason. I read with interest the last few pages where I found out that Wolfe's editor had to piece together several parts of this book, and then he had to write many pages in order to tie this mess together. All of this occured after Wolfe's death. I believe this is a collection of ramblings from Thomas Wolfe. I am sure that I can be attacked verbally for not understanding the meaning of this great work, but if it was truly a great work, I would not have missed its significance.

"Hard rock meets ambient: Listening to the song 'Alone' right now compels me to write this review. If nothing, buy this CD only for this track. A 10-minute long epic ambient composition. Showcases the genius that Moby is. There are several other very good songs on this album. This album is predominantly hard/punk rock with some softer ambient pieces sparsed in between. Most people know Moby for his work on techno and ambient music, but here Moby shows his versatility by doing an equally good job with hard rock. Many of the songs have him screaming at the top of his voice, but rest assured, they are still good and not average hard/punk rock music. Again, Moby shows that he doesn't go by what sells. Rather he goes by his artistic instinct and likes to experiment with different genres of music.Most of Moby's works are highly underrated and misunderstood. This is one of them. Moby's music is intelligent music. Unfortunately, not many people can understand or appreciate that.

I am quite used to period performances of romantic music but this feels really unique. The more I listen, I start to appreciate and understand the point in using the playing style that they do. I realize that this is very close to the way it ones sounded and that is very exciting I think. The lack of constant vibrato and the glissandos that are frequently used creates a completely new atmosphere which I think is very suitable for this music. I really recommend this disc and believe that the Eroica quartet has a bright future ahead of itself. And that what they do today...will shape the sound of tommorow!

"Enthralling: My son and I started reading parts of this in the car on a trip. We are both aficionados of anything mythological, and encountering these profound, rich, and unusual stories has been inspiring to both of us (but probably most inspiring to my son). The stories we have read so far are presented both as myths, but also as possibilities, expanding the idea of what might have been and what might be, offering also a window of insight into the times in which the myths were captured. The myths are largely framed within the context of the Christian and Roman Catholic Church and culture, and do reveal some of the bias of the times against the Jews and Judaic faith. While not politically correct, this is a solid well-written work with much education potential, if placed in context and not read as a sole work on the topic.

This film goes heavy on the gross-out and special effects because the story is weak and full of holes. The original was much scarier because of what you didn't see. The imagination is a powerful tool. We can imagine much worse that what we see. Just knowing the blob was somewhere, without actually seeing too much of it provided me with years of nightmares. I own the DVD of the original and watch it at least six or seven times a year. Matt Dillon was the flavor of the month when the remake came out. His performance was less than remarkable.

"Endless Supply of Ink: The ink was inexpensive, considering how much ink it is. I think it will take me at least a year or two to use it all. I've been writing with the pen nonstop as my primary pen for 2 months and the first bottle isn't even noticiably lower on ink. Shipping was also fast and everthing arrived in good shape.

"This book makes anyone think he/she can write a screenplay with the inner movie method...: Wonderful intro...author clearly explains that if the readers want a more difficult route they can go with Syn Field's books, but this book will get you off and running & thinking about the task of screenwriting. For what the author intends to do, I give her 5stars.The Inner Movie Method is the start of your journey to writing a screenplay or to just understanding the movies you see better. It's concise, upbeat & ""can do"" in spirit.Accessible. Short Chapters. Exercises. Some good summaries. I like her overview of the stages of life & movie theme that concern each.A pleasure to read. Guaranteed to enhance your movie going experience.But again... this is a place to begin.

"Sarah and O'Malley: Excellent description of these two characters; Sarah is an alien, but she is also a woman who is desired and connected to O'Malley. Neither character realizes just what is happening to them at first during the landing of Sarah's spacecraft. While she is saved by O'Malley and his crew she has already defended herself on the spacecraft from some of her enemies.(Also aliens) She is very near death when it crashes in the mountains near the VLA (very large array)in New Mexico. Both Sarah and O'Malley have led very colorful lives before this encounter--and both want out of that past life. This is a book that has to be read when you have the time to just do it, cause it was hard for me to put it down.

This is the story of how a small group with a generally poor and ill membership overcomes the harshness of the environment and forged a new chapter of Buddhism.

"Very disappointed!: Very disappointed with this item! First, when the knife arrived it obviously had been a return from someone else because the plastic was sliced open and the knife had been removed before. But, my son really wanted this for Christmas, so I kept it because I had not been able to find another one anywhere else. It was a Christmas present, and the leather sheath broke on Christmas Day after wearing it only about 5 hours! However, my son was very happy with the knife, so now we are trying to find another sheath for it.

"Good video, Great Gift for new Parents: This video is an excellant video for new Moms and Dads, and in addition for anyone who will be helping with the newborn, to give Mom and Dad a break. The only drawback I found with the video was the length of the video. I wished it had gone into more detail , most specifically caring for the crying baby, and also, care of the baby up to 6 months. However, I can find no fault in this being a beginners tool for learning, and also, a refresher for us who have not taken care of an infant in many years. I purchased this video for first time parents. I wanted to watch it before giving it to make sure it would be something I would be glad to give as a present. I am glad and the parents were very happy to receive. See visually is great because reading is good but for those who are visual people, the instructions from this video will be more helpful.

I found instead a book riddled with cliches, superficial character development and a predictable conclusion. Having just read Ian McEwan's Atonement, the contrast was dramatic.

Actually didn't read it, I did this one on audio, there were different narrators for the stories lending different voices and all well done.Although the theme of hiring hit men was repeated in some of these stories, they all kept me guessing. Also since they were all with twist endings I anticipated what might happen but didn't often see what was coming.This is my first Jeffery Deaver book. I had avoided them since I HATED the movie of ""Bone Collector"" but I now want to read some more of his books; I'm hoping that Hollywood ruined a good writer's work.

"Deaver's short stories are a joy: Jeffrey Deaver is a master at creating the twist ending that you never see coming, and these stories certainly showcase his talents. I had a wonderful time reading them and every time he surprised me with the twists - sometimes several twists in each story. I particularly was caught flat-footed by ""Triangle"" and ""The Christmas Present"" (which had one of those multi-twists I mentioned). Of course, as I said, I was surprised and delighted by each of the stories and I'm sure that anyone who is familiar with Mr. Deaver's work and/or who enjoys thrillers/suspense will enjoy the stories in this book. Characters range from Shakespeare (oh, yea!) to Deaver's iconic Lincoln Rhyme as well as a host of new characters to delight and entertain readers.And, of course, once you've finished this one you can go on and get the sequel,More Twisted: Collected Stories, Vol. II. Both books heartily endorsed by yours truly!

"I want my [money] back!: I was the only one in my senior English class who loved the epic poem. Several years later I bought a copy of it at a comic book shop.For some reason, I liked Christopher Lambert, and I thought he would be a good actor for a movie based on this classic tale.Man, was I wrong!Aside from the names of the hero and one of the villians, this movie has almost nothing in common with the poem. It's got nothing in common with a good movie. It's a travesty!The acting, even with a so-called ""top talent"" like Christopher Lambert, is awful. The setting is almost non-existant, and the plot, ah yes, the plot ....I knew this movie would reek within the first 10 minutes. I mean, I tried really hard to be open-minded, but it was to no avail.Spare yourself the pain and skip the movie. Settle in on a dark winter's night by a fire, put on some quiet music, and read the epic poem. You'll be glad you did.

"It is a Lambert movie: Bad special effects. Lambert looked bored at times. The plot has a few holes. Too much cleavage. Bad fight scenes. Beowulf can do multiple black flips and spin in the air and yet the monsters can still hit him!

It is not the worst movie I have ever seen and I pretty much got what I expected so I'm not completely trashing it. The weapons were cool.

I am impressed with her ability to relive the experience while being fair to both sides and making their decisions and feelings make sense, even when they are directly opposing. The most remarkable thing is her feelings about the modern convents given her struggle and her respect for what was. Her respect is contagious - she gave it to me! She, and her experiences, seem to ratify my own even as mine pale against her story. I recommend it to anyone seriously trying to understand God in their own lives and in their own terms.

"Needlessly Repetitive to Make the Story More Interesting: This is the first Hillerman story I've read, so I understand that I'm missing a bunch of background on the Chee and Leaphorn characters and my overall enjoyment might be hindered. However, of the 350 pages or so of this book, at least 50 could be eliminated due to the repetitive writing. The same bits of story being told two or even three times for no apparent reason. I found myself wondering, again and again, if I had already gone over something only to realize that yes, I had!I am all for a story languidly and specifically unwinding toward its conclusion, as this one does. I think, however, that it needs to be done with some forward momentum and it needs to be able to maintain a certain level of interest for the reader. The writing here is weak and the story, not just obvious, is really just kind of boring.I am looking forward to trying out another title in Hillerman's canon with better results.

"Cibo Matto has made an incredibly boring album: Having heard the decent track by Cibo Matto ""Sci-fi Wasabi"" on a CMJ sampler, I bought STEREOTYPE A thinking it might have other songs in the same vein. Much to my dismay, it honestly is a boring album. Nearly the songs sound the same, and the singing of Miho Hatori and Yuka Honda is inept and lazy.Cibo Matto, like several other Japanese artists (most notably Towa Tei), tried to use the American fascination with seemingly alien culture to sell this album. In the end, all one gets is a collection of 14 yawn-inducing filler-pop tracks. It has no redeeming qualities, and I would recommend that people would find much more worthy music to spend their money on.

"A delicious spiritual journey.: For all those who have been, are, or are going to embark on a spiritual shopping spree, Mick Browns ""A Spiritual Tourist"" is a delicious rendering of one journalists journey. He remains scheptical and distanced from his subject matter throughout. Though on the odd occasion he cannot help but get involved and be affected by the people he meets. From the appearence of ""verbati"" in London, to joining the throngs that sit at the feet of Si Baba, (though I did find this chapter long winded) to a meeting with the Dali Lama and the Theosophical society, to crosses appearing on the windows of a church in the United States and his final chapter, which I perticularly enjoyed, being a visit to a Buddist centre in England, his journey is informative, honest and inspiring.

I believe that Mach3 cartridges are more widely available than Schick Quatro cartridges, and that the 4 blades were overkill (let's wait for the 7-blade razor to see how that works)Also with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, they arrive at my door with discount and I never run out of them.

"good piece of collection: This video reflects the early years of Pink Floyd. In that time a bunch of innovative guys, mainly Syd probably because his use of sychedelic stuff, trying to bring something new in terms of music. If you are a real fan this would be very rare and interesting but if you expect the late sound of PF with Waters and Gilmour maybe you will feel quite shocked. I rated it 4 because is a short document and the sound is not the best although for this kind of information this is not important, the real value of the video is to see them in the context of a very important moment in the history of pop music.

"Superb Short Stories!: This book is a delightful surprise, with a wide range of well-crafted short stories sure to entertain any fan of the genre.A few of them resonate with the reader long after the book's finished, particularly a tale involving the history of a backwoods baptismal pool, and a married couple's slow and sweet farewell after the wife is diagnosed with a terminal illness.

"Update of the old book: It was a rather frustrating book since it was just an update of the previous generation book for VC++ 6.0. It seems that SAMS wanted to be the first to sell in order to sell.

Not having watched this series on tv as we do not have cable or an atenna in our home i was unaware of the skanky nature of this season. The intellegence and absence of immorality that i have seen on the few episodes i watched outside the home caused me to purchase. I am extremely disappointed in this episode and the following one. The rounchyness far out weighed the intellegence by far. Now i am very very leary about purchasing any other episodes. I did enjoyed episode one which i borrowed from my neice.

Hope that they release a full version sometime soon. Its a shame that this movie was so downgraded from the original.Bottom line: dont waste your money.

Here we go: stock-shots ripped off from 'Thirty seconds over Tokyo', 'Tora Tora Tora' and probably other movies, WWII newsreels footage extensively cropped to fit into the Panavision frame, meaningless cameos by various aging stars -probably to make the flick look like a blockbuster- , historical mistakes and countless errors about planes and aircraft carriers, inept dramatization -the predictable romance between Heston's son and a Japanese girl-, you name it.

"A classic war film. Very underated.: People complain about how this film uses some of the same historic footage ""Tora Tora Tora"" uses. This WWII footage is great and should be used in different war films. Just because it was used in that film dosent mean it can't be used in ""Midway"". It's not like they took scenes made for ""Tora Tora Tora"" and put them in this film. Historic footage is used and reused in many films. How many times have we seen scenes with President Kennedy in different films? The same populer footage of him? This film is an epic war masterpiece. The acting is superb. People complain about the Japanese speaking English. You are supposed to imagine them to be speaking Japanese. It's not like a mistake the film makers made that makes the film appear cheaper or something. This film gets very little credit, and is always in the shadow of ""Tora Tora Tora"". I think, if you collect war films, you should own both. ""Midway"" is a true classic.

The answer: Midway! This reeaallly bad movie suffers from everything. WW2 stock footage is over-used (most of it didn't even take place during the battle of Midway) and the scenes from Tora! Tora! Tora! are out of place. A corny love interest gets in the way of the action too much. Lot's of familiar faces in this, but their acting is uninspired, and the script is dreadful. About 30 minutes of important footage was cut out of the original release (including the battle of the Coral Sea). Please, avoid this film!

"Like being at a drive in...: The film played on countless ""dusk till dawn"" horror bills at drive-ins through the early 80's, and this disc does a pretty good job of taking th viewer back to those long gone days of cheap thrills. The picture and sound quality are only about average, just like the drive-in, the only other thing you need is for someone to park their car outside you living room and honk thier horns during the nude scenes. And the movie? Well it's about average as well. The plot concerns a plot to get an inheritance and a bunch of greedy heirs. A true B movie on all counts, but not without a certain trashy value, those who spent warm summer nights watching this flick when it was paired up with the likes of ""Don't Answer the Phone,"" and ""Point of Terror"" may want to give this reasonably priced disc a look.

"Set of 2 40"" Hardwood Datio Bokken Practice Sword: I bought these for myself and my son for Aikido weapons training. They are not very well made and appear to have been factory seconds. To clarify there are cracks in both to point that they might easily break and splinter. One is practically straight with no curve. The handles are nicely wrapped but the wrapping tends to come off with use. There is also removable plastic guard or tsuba, which is not very functional and more decorative. You get what you pay for and these are not high quality, hence the expensive price. I will eventually buy something better.

"Infiniti by Conair BC173: I have shoulder length curly, fine hair. I followed the directions for use and I ended up with a messy head of frizzy hair. The brush does more blowing than straightening in my opinion - it is fine for drying hair. But I did not get the sleek, smooth, shiny effect that was promised by the straightening tool. It was nothing like the salon straightening job I normally get. I will be returning this styler ASAP. Very unhappy.
",1,1
"Twice the effort for half the sleekness: My hair is about 90% straight and 10% wavy, so you wouldn't think it takes much to make it sleek, straight and shiny; I even use an ant-firzz serum before I style. But using this Conair took twice as long as drying and straightening my hair in two steps, and gave me half as straight hair. I even used my regular blow dryer first to get most of the dampness out, thinking this would speed up the process...but no, it took ages. The Conair is basically a very small hairdryer with a few brush bristles. When I was finished, my hair definitely had frizz and fly aways, and I had to go back over it with my Chi flat iron. I really wanted to like this product and to save time, but I will be returning it.

"Stopped working after second use: The dryer worked fine but I only use a hair dryer occasionally so I'd only used it twice in 6 weeks.

I've seen other reviews with a similar problem so it seems they have some quality control issues to work out and if you buy one, it's the luck of the draw if you get a 'good' one or not. I'm generally very pleased with my purchases through Amazon...but this one was a dud.

"Not what I was hoping for: I was really hoping for a dryer that would get rid of some of the frizz and curls I started getting when I turned 30 - an unexpected and unwelcome byproduct of aging. This seemed perfect, but the dryer is so weak, it takes forever to dry my hair and virtually no straightening effect. After using it, I still have to straighten my hair with a flat iron. So I've gone back to drying my hair with a regular dryer (more power and therefore faster) and using the flat iron. I guess I should have known it sounded too good to be true.

"Baffled: I ordered it, thinking it was something else, and then when it arrived, I was intrigued and had to try it. Okay, it will straighten but not certain the point of it.

"Good ink: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.

"Too thin: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray.

"A waste of money!!!: I remembered watching this movie as a kid and really enjoying it. However, after rewatching the Transformers Season 1 4 disc DVD set, this movie pales in comparison. The characters lacked personality and didn't look as interesting as the others. I recommend that you save your money and put it towards the more expensive, but more enjoyable, DVD box sets.

"forgive me.............: Ok, ok, I realize that I am going to be fried for this but here goes.......I loved this movie as a child. I worshiped the TV series and I still have quite the collection of Autobots, and Decepticons. However, when my friend got me this film for my birthday, I watched it and found that it really did not hold my interest anymore. I think this film better served its purpose in the 80's, and is truly lost in today's modern era of animation. I would, however, like to see this film remade with better animation, and a FAR better soundtrack. I love the toys, but I did not like this movie.

"MATRIX FOREVER!! OUT OF PRINT> AGAIN!!!!!: I can not believe this has gone out of print again. Its the greatest anime movie ever.It always goes through long periods of time being unnavailable. I don't get it.Maybe the next DVD version will be better than this one. This version was great for being uncensored. But the extras were weak. It should have at least had two discs and included the alternate TV version. Or at least its opening Star Wars styled scrollthat replaced the opening credits. The music video ""The Touch"" was also not included. Also excluded were the animated bumpers narrated by a computer animated ""Optimus Prime"" that played when the movie aired on television in 5 partson the TV series. They would have made a nice extra.

"Darryls Review on Transformers 20th Anniversary dvd: Great movie. To date the best version out there. 2 disc! It was great watching it with commentary from fans. This was just awesome. The colour and widescreen format are surperb. Many special features including commentaries, interviews, trailers etc. The Scramble City episode which is a special feature, which I was looking forward to fell below expectations due to the fact you could only watch it with commentary. Only about four toy commercials. There are easter eggs on both discs (old Diaclone toy commercials). Overall a great addition to my dvd collection and fully recommended.

There's no DVD icon on the desktop. I tried on both OS 9 and OS X, and ""df -k"" on OS X did not show a mounted volume in the DVD drive.Since the TF Season 1 Collector's Edition DVD discs play fine on the same laptop, it's got to be the TFTM DVD disc that's mastered non-Macintosh compatible.

"The Soviet view of the Cold War: Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended.

"Morey is ignorant of the literature: This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the ""responsible"" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's ""Whenis it right to Fight? Never"", available from Pilgrim Brethren Press, po box 171, Petersburg, Ohio 44454. Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me.

"Shallow and Poorly Thought Out: The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind.

"BAD BACKSTREET BOYS: If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect: a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs. In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality. Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly. By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending. DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods.

"Tough going: Reading this novel was slow going. As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them. The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered. There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing. Not one of Jane Austen's best.

"Just OK: The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility. Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite. I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie ""Clueless"". However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it. It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.

"Help us all: I am quite confused on how people could like this book. For one it takes forever to get to the point. Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain. I think Jane Austen was right when she said "" no one but myself will much like [Emma].""

"I Hate Emma: I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting.

I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.

"Doesn't survive the test of time: I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention.

"Austen sparkles as always, but this is no Pride and Prej!: Personally, I love everything Jane Austen ever wrote to BITS. But none of her works (except maybe the humorously offbeat ""Northanger Abbey"") can match the high standards set by ""Pride and Prejudice"". There's the usual cast of comic characters, and some scenes really are a scream, but the heroine, Emma Woodhouse, and her 'consort' Frank Churchill are a bit too brattish for my liking. Their 'humour' (acidly bitchy spoilt brat gossip about the most kind-hearted and guileless members of the village) is just a little too vicious for me, and their appalling treatment of Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith, and the hilarious Miss Bates left me feeling a bit sick. Thank God Mr. Knightley's there to keep Emma in line. This is still a great novel, as witty and funny as ""Pride and Prejudice""--but it's comedy with a bit of a nasty undertaste.

With the assistance of Wilbur, an albatross, and numerous other friends encountered along the way (such as a wise-cracking kangaroo rat), they hurry to help the endangered bird. Voice talents of Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Miss Bianca) and John Candy (Wilbur) move the story along at a good pace. George C. Scott provides voice for the villain, a bounty hunter of endangered animals. Scott's sidekick is a goanna lizard called Joana - and there is some fascinating interplay between the lizard and the man. A sidebar plot is Bernard's plan to propose marriage to Miss Bianca ... and all of the things that conspire to get in the way. This is a nice movie for the entire family, and one with a good message.

"This book did not teach me anything I didn't already know: If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much.

"The Best Bible Story Book We Own!: We own many Bible story books, but this one is my favorite. We read from this book every day, and the kids love it. It includes stories that are left out of many children's Bible story books. It is wonderful to read in order, and it really keeps the attention of the children. When it's time to shut the book, my kids say, ""What's the story for tomorrow called, Mommy?"", because they so look forward to reading this book.

"The gateway to another world!: I started the book when I was seven or so, and I almost couldn't put it down at night! Each chapter has gripping detail, enough violence to satesfy a kid my age, and the charecter's actions and feelings were so real-like that I felt like I was right there, at a Gathering, right there, at the fight between ThunderClan and ShadowClan, right there, in the ThunderClan camp. I'm ten now, have read the whole first series twice and have started the second series, and I'd recomend this book to any kid who likes cats, excitment, adventure, and a litle pinch of violence now and then in their books.

"plotless: It is an undramatic visage of what should be a dramatic era of Margaret Thatcher. An example paragraph of the endless descriptions that mar the book (if i'm breaking copyrights laws, let me know):Nick wasn't sure how it started. Sam Zeman was laughing so much he lay back on the floor, but then choked and had to sit up. One of the girls pointed at him mockingly, but it wasn't mockery, she was laughing uncontrollably herself. Nat was red in the face, pinching the tears out of his eyes and pulling down the corners of his mouth to try to stop it. Nick could only stop giggling by glaring at the floor, and as soon as he looked up he was giggling again convulsively, it was like hiccups, it was hiccups, all mixed up together with the whooping, inexplicable funniness of the brandy bottle, the Renoir lady, the gilded plaster crown above the bed, all of them with their ideas and bow ties and plans and objections.

"Not worth it: After finally finishing this book, I am very surprised that it won a prize. The first several hundred pages have the main character (Nick Guest) doing little more than having sex, fantasizing about having sex with every other male character (major or minor), or wondering if anyone else can guess that he's fantasizing about sex.Perhaps it would be a better read for someone British, because I found it hard to appreciate the depiction of life in the British aristocracy. The character development felt very heavy-handed and repetitive, as one scene after another depicted Nick feeling embarrassed or trying to figure out how to handle a social situation.The end of the book was much more rewarding, as the web of characters unravelled and their pretensions were stripped away. I also enjoyed some clever Henry James references. Still, I don't think the investment it takes to slog through the beginning is worth it overall.

"social scientists, take your medecine!: Sowell is a true intellectual. He is not afraid to go where his mind takes him. In this work he takes on his common peeve: social engineering. For Sowell nothing is worse than utopian minded do-gooders armed with inadequate knowledge of the subjects they pontificate on.

"*THE* XML book for .NET: Dino Esposito has total, absolute command of the subject matter that he expertly teaches in this book. This is a template for how all technical training books should be written. I wanted in-depth coverage of the XML object library in .NET and that is exactly what this book delivers. This is THE book on XML in .NET. Don't waste your money on anything else.It is also terrific supplemental material for the Developing XML Web Services and Server Components certification exam. I recommend Mike Gunderloy's book as an all-encompassing source (look up my review for that book); however, I recommend reading the first four chapters of this book before you start Gunderloy's book if you don't have much experience reading and writing XML in .NET. Chapters 12 and 13 on remoting and web services, respectively, are also great sources of exam prep material. In fact, Chapter 12 on .NET Remoting is the best chapter on the subject you will find anywhere.Terry, MCAD and MCSD for Microsoft .NET

"Singular work of genius arrives in fish wrap: The greatest achievement in western literature is now available in a bound version heretofore reserved for second rate ""How to"" books from the remainder bin. This publisher offers no preface, foreword, notes, or so much as an illustrator's credit for the apt cover; the sole redeeming feature of this tawdry effort. Usually clocking in at 740 pages plus, this version manages to squeeze every word of the masterwork into a nimble 554 pages, thanks to a total lack of margin space or chapter breaks. Laughably, the book's spine does not allow even for this squeezed assembly, so that it arrives splayed and bow-legged, in unintentional tribute to the willowy author perhaps. Under-inked to the point of appearing mimeographed, with serifs giving way on almost every page, this is hardly the version one needs of a book to be cherished and re-visited often.

"A Masterpiece of English Literature: After finally summoning the courage to attempt a reading of Ulysses, I am profoundly greatful that I did. While the novel is intricately layered and multi-referenced, reading it is really not as challenging as its reputation would have one believe. Moreover, it is a page-turner in the truest sense; never before have I been so absorbed by a piece of literature. Joyce's relentless and masterful descriptions of characters' thoughts, both important inner monologues and equally flippant patter, offer an insight into the human condition which is unparalled in English literature. I am utterly convinced that Ulysses is the most important novel of the twentieth century; it is a true masterpiece of literary art, one that simply makes the reader proud to be human.

"The definitive Romeo & Juliet!: Italian director Franco Zeffirelli did an outstanding job of bringing Shakespeare's romantic tale to life. It is THE definitive version of Romeo & Juliet, in my opinion. The fact that the actors were so close to the age of the star crossed lovers adds realism and freshness to the story.Shakespeare's words flow so naturally that you forget that it is a classic play and just get lost in the story. The cinematography is beautifully done and the wonderful customes are a treat for the eyes!You will enjoy this movie ... again, and again ... I highly recommend it!

"Romeo & Juliet: Love at First Sight: Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other 15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!

"the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse.

"But They're Not On an Airplane!: I was extremely disappointed with Airplane II: The Sequel. The first one was great, and I'd watch it over and over again. But since I've seen the sequel, it hasn't been as funny. The sequel's pretty unoriginal and the replayed humor detracts from its predessor it's the same love story, and a smattering of redone scenes. (Rember the old woman who hung herself?) I wouldn't buy this one. In fact, I wouldn't even spend the money to rent it on DVD; save yourself a few bucks, rent it on VHS.

"More Groans Than Laughs: Weak, derivative, and thoroughly unfunny - classic example of a studio cashing in with the old Good Movie Rehash. (...). Although what's funny and what isn't is often a matter of opinion, the element of surprise is what defines humor. We laugh when the unexpected happens. But having seen it all before in the original, nothing - and I mean NOTHING - is funny in Airplane 2. Even the new jokes are variations on a theme. Save your money and watch Airplane! twice.

"Strictly for Seattle radicals (all others need not apply).: This movie is in black and white (better still, in black and red!) and I don't mean colorwise. It's your standard politically-correct hagiography where good guys ooze beatitude, bad guys reek evil, and if you don't root for the former, you belong with the latter. Like history told this way? If so, then you're gonna love it; if not, at least you'll get some laughs.Mind you, it's not that I object the fake look, dubbed dialogue, hammy overacting or holier-than-thou attitude of everyone concerned in this dated political flick from the sixties; I mean, we were all pretty much ridiculous ourselves back then. But Joan Baez's awful lyrics and worst wailing tear apart the movie's only redeeming asset: Ennio Morricone's beautiful music score. Now that's a true crime!So you've been warned!

"A Spark for Social Reform: The purpose of this book is to heighten awareness about consumerism and ultimately bring about dramatic change in our society. The audience is primarily Americans, though the book has been well received in several foreign countries. De Graaf and his associates present powerful evidence from a wide collection of sources. Their argument is persuasive and well documented. They address environmental, social, financial, spiritual, physical and mental indicators of health in our society. Affluenza has made me more aware of how I spend my money, time and intellectual effort by highlighting some of our societies weaknesses. I enjoyed reading the book because it made me question some of my practices. The authors throw down the gauntlet by challenging many ""American principles."" Overall, the argument is sound and effective, if a bit dramatic at times. A copy of should come free with every new BMW, satellite TV dish and MBA degree. America needs it.

"Not Just ""Borderline"" Terrible--It Is Terrible!: Thank your ""Lucky Star"" if you miss this one. This movie is so bad I don't know where to start. I don't like Madonna to begin with. It's bad enough that I have to hear her belt out her crappy pop ditties on the radio and see her face plastered on magazine covers, but this so-called ""movie"" is quite possibly the worst thing she's unleashed on the public. It's even worse than ""Body of Evidence"" and that's saying something. Maybe I'm prejudiced against Madonna, but I was willing to give this movie a chance...boy, do I regret it.

"Madonna is an embarrassment...: This movie is So very bad on so many different levels, that it is almost beneath any serious movie lover or critic to waste time viewing it. Madonna is at her all time low, and it is a low that few stars ever reach. She is a terribly bad actress and this time out, she made even her die-hard fans cringe in embarassment for her. Simply put, there is no guesswork here...there is not a redeaming quality in this movie. The acting, script, direction, tone, pace, etc., are all at an extremely shoddy level, and DAMN is she getting painful to look at. The only comfort comes in the knowledge of the FACT that this movie was completely shunned by not only critics but by the public as well. Even Madonna's legion of fans couldn't get her out of this one. It bombed on every level.

The movie simply careens, in a nearly plot free fashion, from one set-piece of computer enhanced combat to another. Now, I like a good, violent action movie as much as the next guy, but this one wasn't good. Watching it reminded me of watching somebody play the ""Mortal Kombat"" type video games of the 90's.

In closing, my solemn hope is that the mummy won't return again.

"What a waste of time: This refers to the Australian Region 4 Collector's Edition. The picture quality is excellent. The DTS soundtrack (yes, this is standard on the R4 DVD unlike the R1)is of reference quality and quite outstanding in dynamic range (especially in the water-wall sequence). Unfortunately, the film was a total waste of time and I think studios should be paying audiences to watch films like this. No where near as good as the original -very formulaic and it felt almost like a cartoon with its over reliance on CGI. I scanned through most of the movie and I feel sorry for everyone who thinks this is worth buying. Even if a free copy was offered I would not accept -because I would never watch it again! And the bonus materials! Who cares about this when the film is so pathetic. I hope I'm not a minority who thinks film substance is still more important than its technical merits. I have invested in home theatre to enjoy films not gunfire, car chases and explosions.

Tom Cruise said in an interview that it IS possible to follow the plot (but, obviously there is a problem if he has to point that out!). But does that mean one has to rewind certain sections five times, to get all the dialogue details? Movies are not like books. In theaters, you can't flip back five pages, to refresh in your mind who a certain character is. So things should be spelled out with CLARITY. Something this film is woefully lacking. Having said that, DePalma is a great stylist-director, and as a music video, this isn't a total loser. But as a movie, it is.

There is none of the intrigue or ingenuity that was so integral to the series. The movie could have and should have been made under a different title. Why was it necessary to spoil the memory of a great TV series with this nonsense?Without revealing any of the plot, let me just say that the denouement is particularly awful, in that it puts one of the main characters from the TV show in a very negative light. This particular plot element was completely unnecessary and un-called for. No reason to see this at all.

"Get this book and go!: The People's Guide is a pure delight, a labor of love about Mexico. It's a travel book that is actually fun to read. It's also full of useful information about just about everything; how to travel, where to stay, how to stay healthy, how to deal with the law, some basics on the language, and much more. And every bit of it feels like advice from someone who has learned it all through years of experience, some of it painful, most of it joyful.What it is not is a book listing all the hotels, restaurants, stores, museums, and so forth. (There is a short section - The Best of Mexico - with specific suggestions, but it's just a starting point.) If your approach to travel is as footloose and unplanned as the authors, this may be the only book you need. If you like a little more structure, you will want to supplement it with traditional guidebooks for the areas you plan to visit.

Old Siam Sir sits with other forgotten Mccartney classic rockers such as Girls' School, Soily and The Mess all of which fit neatly with the best Rock and Roll he wrote for that other group (in many ways they are rawer than most of what he wrote for them). Arrow Through Me is one of those delicate pieces that McCartney writes that somehow manage to rock in a subtle way. The Rockestra highlights work well on this album, but are perhaps better on Concert for Kampuchea. The generally stripped down sound of this album allows the listener to appreciate the musicianship of Wings Mark 3.

We cherish our mother daughter routine of reading these books together every night. Also the characters are wholesome. There is a line drawn between good and evil. Some of the more contemporary books like Junie B.

In his history of this classic car, told from a British perspective, the text is easy to read, and the author displays a thorough understanding of how cars work.

I learned *why* the ignition key is on the floor (safety feature), and got further insights into this small company's heritage as an innovator, e.g. how, with the 96, they had an extremely aerodynamic car rivalled only by the Citroen DS, or how they insisted, for safety reasons, on using heavier sheet metal than other makers, explaining its enduring status among automotive brands.

I think it is too narrow to focus on the journalistic or the tobacco-industry elements of The Insider. Like HEAT before it, Mann's film is a highly dramatized portrayal of ethics in the modern world. Truly a remarkable film that earns everything it asks for from the audience. On a lesser note, I also think it is something really unique when big-budget Hollywood productions such as this one eschew explosions and spaceships to focus on telling a human story.

When a script and the characters within it have no definition, no relevance, and no entertainment value - watching it becomes either self-torture or an exercise in pretending that it serves some arty vision.

I think with any epilator, it's gonna hurt, but since the hair doesn't grow back as fast, and comes back finer it is sooo worth it. The more you use it, the less it hurts, so don't give up, it gets better! Also, I've noticed that even with occasional use (about 6 times a year), about 25% of my hair has stopped growing back, and what has come back is much finer. Unfortunately, I have such fair skin that I need to remove the hair either by epilating or waxing since you can still see the folicle after shaving! The epilator is much more financially and environmentally better than having to wax for me.

I am an engineer also, and am not threatened by the technical information (admittedly lifted from his students' term papers). I have chemical engineering textbooks that read like a novel. Hopefully the courses he teaches are clearer than this muddled prose.Petroski is certainly an engineer. He has engineered an elegant method of making money from saps like us.

All of them have unraveled stitching during the first wash causing the underwire to poke out. All were hand washed and were hung to dry so I'm afraid it can't be blamed on machines.

"Faith in this Movie: Nortan (Fight Club; American History X), Elfman (Sitcom ""Dharma and Greg""), and Stiller (Meet the Parents) light it up in this warm-hearted comedy about 3 friends from grade school who haven't seen each other in year, now thrown back together when Elfman comes running back into their lives. Nortan and Stiller, now clergymen, (Nortan a Catholic Priest, Stiller a Jewish Rabbi) both find the old friendship they once knew in their beloved tom-boyish beauty of a friend Elfman. But throughout it all, there is denial, lying, antitrust, and a passionate love triangle forms. Now who will end up following their faith and who will end up following their hearts? Nortan, Elfman, and Stiller deliver a spectacular and heart gripping performance in this romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed by men nor women alike.

"Sweet romantic comedy...: Ben Stiller and Edward Norton play best friends Jake and Brian, a rabbi and a priest who are both strong leaders in their congregations. When their friend Anna visits them, both friends fall for her and find themselves questioning their faiths.This is a sweet and often funny movie that is well written and acted by the cast. Religion can be a tough subject to base a comedy around, but Keeping the Faith does pretty well. The plot itself seems to unwind a bit near the end, but Ben Stiller and Edward Norton keep it afloat pretty well.This is a pretty good movie, so I recommend it for a Saturday afternoon.

"After 21 Years....: ...I finally saw this film again and it wasn't too bad, though typical of the time it came out, as far as sound, photography, SPFX and acting, though the four leads were great: Randy Quaid, the beautiful Kate Capshaw (this was only her second film), Max Von Sydow and of course Christopher Plummer. It arrived from Amazon just days before Eddie Albert died but I didn't get around to watching it till a few days after that, so it was kinda bittersweet to watch. I could barely recall anything of it since I'd seen it only once at its initial theatrical release so this was a nice reminder. I recommend this to anyone looking for 99 minutes to kill if they've nothing else to do.Unintentional funny moment: When the paramedics try reviving a dead Mrs. Matusik the actress moves a split second before the paddles touch her.

"Suprisingly enjoyable: ""Blow"" is a well done film depicting an era. Though the point of ""blow"" is kind of hard to figure out, it is an interesting movie to watch, and you find yourself mysteriously rooting for Jung as he rises and falls.The best part of this film is the first part detailing Jung's rise to fame, and his doomed relationship with his first girlfriend. The shots of California and the beach are the quintessential way that we all wish it truly were.Somewhat depressing, somewhat amusing, and always entertaining, you won't go wrong adding ""Blow"" to your collection. Depp is always good in all his roles.

"DEPP COULDN'T SAVE THIS ONE: This film portrays large scale drug dealers as guerilla marketing experts. It's long on make-up and period costume and short on cool dialogue or good acting. Hispanic actors portray Columbians using exaggerated accents and they appear more middle eastern than latin american. Good cameos by Ray Liotta and Pee-Wee Herman.

"Amazing: Camus's novel truley symbolizes the coldness of modern life. He creates one of the great literary characters of all time and paints a powerful image of mankind's true state.

"Profound, Poetic, and Disturbing: A terrific read. Very dry, engaging, and clips along at a good pace. I finished it in less than three hours, and felt that I had witnessed part of myself on Camus' stage. M. Meursault is, for the most part, an ordinary person who has been benumbed by a daily existence of ""getting by."" Finding himself so dulled, that finally, he is a mere spectator in his own life. ""Effect"" instead of ""Cause."" The story begins with a death, and ends with a death. In the folds of each is found new life, whether it is his Maman's ""fiancee"" or Meursault's own rebirth of consciousness in his final minutes. Perhaps through this story, we can all find something of ourselves in M. Meursault, and heed the warning that seems to glare in mile-high neon. Be ""Cause."" Not ""Effect."" Get out and LIVE. Live heroically instead of being a spectator or simply ""getting by.&quot

Plus, in high school, I thought I was an existentialist.This story is really interesting and a great book to read if you're at all into the Cure - it's like adding some street cred or something - not really, but I feel somehow more orderly by having read it.It's short, easy to read and gives an interesting view of life - it is written by quite a well known (ie. accessible) philosopher after all. One could call it a nice intro to existentialism or an addition to your goth music research, cuz you know you love to research music.

"SO overrated: This is a top contender for the worst book ever written. I thought about giving it a tied position with Pamela Anderson's _Star_, but upon reflection I have decided that I would rather read _Star_ again than read _The Stranger_ again, although I would rather be eaten alive by rabid wolverines than do either. This book is so bad that it is painful for me to read it. If I had a time machine, I would pay to have Camus beaten to death on a deserted beach, ultimately preventing this disaster from ever coming into existence.

"Not existentialist - depressed!: I read The Stranger when I was young but didn't really get much out of it. I recently reread it and was struck by the lack of emotion on the part of the protagonist, Muersault. Forget existentialist - this man was depressed. He has all the hallmarks of it - doesn't care about anything, has no joy in his existence. It doesn't so much bother me that he didn't care about his mother's death; she was older, apparently not in good health and they weren't close. But what does bother me is the casual way he deals with the murder he committed. It seems almost beside the point- the man he killed had done nothing to Muersault justifying the murder. More than anything else, his flat attitude reminded me of the murderers in In Cold Blood. There were some serious mental health issues that this man had.

"Existentialism at its finest!: The Stranger was a summer reading assignment for my senior year of high school, and I devoured every word of it. Albert Camus should be read by every student of literature,history, and philosophy. His prose is fluid, his style uncompromising. He reflects the lack of definite meaning that life sometimes has. Camus earned his place in the French literary canon. It is time that the American literary canon adds him among their elite as well. I hope to read this novel again, but in French.

"Can we escape our past ?: This is the central question explored by Conrad in Lord Jim. Jim is ultimately a character who inspires our sympathy due to his inability to find reconcilliation for his one tragic moment of weakness. In him we find a person of tremendous potential that remains unrealized as the tragic circumstances of his abandoning his post aboard the Patna continually haunt him and the associated guilt drives him to isolation.Conrad successfully explores the concepts of bravery, cowardice,guilt and the alternative destinies that an individual may be driven to by these qualities.The narrative can be a bit confusing at times as Marlowe relates the tale by recalling his encounters with Jim. The book reminded very much of Somerset Maugham's THE RAZOR""S EDGE"" in style. However I believe that Maugham did a much better job of incorporating the narrator into the flow of the story. Overall LORD JIM is a wonderful classic novel that I highly recommend.

"A Little Hard to Follow for a Timeless Classic: Perhaps it is the nineteenth century writing style or the nautical terminology, but the pronoun-laced conversational passages have left me wondering who was on first, or who was the first mate.Conrad was a pathbreaker in the subjects he treated and no doubt had interesting experiences, but I prefer his other works.

"Couldn't finish it: Ugh. This might have been a good book if it were half the size, but Conrad strains to keep the plot going amid the endless descriptions of sea, sky, and the characters' states of mind. Move along, move along! This ancient icon may be a monument to Conrad's mastery of his second language, and it may be a tragic psychological exploration of the universal heroic destiny (or something equally dense), but listening to it doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat.

"A great work of art: This book works on so many levels, it's mind boggling...it's an adventure story, it's a philosophical novel of ideas, it's got brilliant use of language. Like a painter, Conrad creates effects by deciding what to put in and what to leave out; he shifts narrators and fractures the time sequence to get maximum impact from his story. If you don't get it the first time, try again (I've read it many, many times). It's pure poetry and a genuinely profound book. The review below from VA that describes Conrad's theme (facing your fears) is totally right on the money -- so face your fears about reading a difficult book, buy a copy of Lord Jim and read it, and you'll be a better person for the experience.

"This book is thorough but poorly written.: It is ironic that an account of the Steely Dan phenomenon is documented by someone whose writing skills are negligable. Becker and Fagen, two contemporary literary masters by most standards, would find it strangely fitting, I suppose. Sweet's saving grace is his penchant for detail. His tome has the stories for which every avid Dan fan hungers. Recording sessions, writing sessions, band reformulations, personal melodramas, etc. These elements make it enjoyable reading, especially when accompanied by revisitations to the legendary recordings. Listening to the CD's while making one's chronological journey through this book, is distictly thrilling, as well as eye(ear)-opening. The lack of an index and of footnotes limits this volume's usefulness as a reference source however. It would be nice to see a similar effort made by a writer who posesses a similar creative energy, quirkiness and skill to that of Becker and Fagen themselves.

Sam had left letters for Jennifer to read that showed that Sam's life wasn't at all as picture perfect as people may have believe it to be.

"NOT the originals: While the sound quality on these disks is excellent, be aware that app. 50% of the tunes are not the originals. Shout Factory should be ashamed, duping customers like this.

However years ago, the movie started with the introduction of the first, the one zombie walking through the graveyard. He was introduced as the murderer of a little girl and it showed his trial, execution and then him rising from his coffin killing the burial detail before he heads in Barbara's direction. I don't know why they edited this part out. It gave the movie a little more substance., ,

"Lol...Filth: My absolute FAVORITE horror movie of ALL time is ""Night of the Living Dead""...The 1968, black/white, low budget version. I started watching the 1990 version 'Sci-Fi' one afternoon, and I didn't stop watching it until it was over...Why? It was hilarious...Plus they had a better zombie movie on afterwards, and I didn't have anything else to do until then... This movie is despicable compared to the original. From terrible dialogue to terrible themes, this movie is just TERRIBLE... If you haven't seen the 1968 version, with all enthusiasm from myself, please watch it a.s.a.p., but never subject yourself to the remake unless you're either punishing yourself, or you need a good laugh...

"Not for everyone: If your main objective, is the study of human relationships,social rapports between humans, and conquering and seducing otherpeople, this movie is for you.Not an embarrassing movie, at all, for any of the actors.

I am very happy that I bought this movie. Don't miss the cheerleader scene. Hugh Jackman was gorgeous.

"Hugh Jackman is scrumptous!!! ;): I actually bought this movie having never seen it. I saw Greg Kinnear on the box and read the blurb on the back and decided it was cheaper to buy it than to rent it. I absolutely fell in love with Hugh Jackman. Ashley Judd is always adorable in romantic comedies. Greg Kinnear is never bad in his roles,(but he sometimes picks horrid roles). The premise is cute and as romantic comedies go it wasn't horrible but it was rather predictable. What made me give it 4 stars is the fact that Hugh Jackman was absolutely delightful as the bad boy casanova. What took Hollywood so long to find him?

For decent folks, it's a very decent 90-minutes of movie magic.

"Scanned from VHS?: This DVD has a very poor transcription of the original. It's either been poorly scanned from a very dirty print of the 16mm film version, or scanned from the VHS. I suspect the latter as the colors are washed out, and the film shows the 'Do not pirate this video tape' warning after the film. I might even be tempted to think this has not been produced by the studio as the DVD menu looks like it was made in iDVD on a Mac.The only plus side is that the film is the full content, including the scenes that are omitted from the TV broadcast version.

"This movie was such a bad movie!: I've always hated this movie, not due to it's ""violent and disturbing content"" but because of it's bad acting and pure stupidity. This movie is a children's movie, anyone who complains that it's too scary and violent for kids is out of thier minds and are being way too uptight ( people like this are the reason why anime is so butchered when it comes to the States!). But that's not what I'm here to talk about, I'm here to talk about how bad this movie is. It's voice actors aren't that good, the wooden boy has equally wooden acting, and the ending of the movie made no sense whatsoever! Come on Disney! Explain to me why Pinoccio suddenly drowns at the end of the movie when earlier on the was walking at the botton of the ocean talking to the fish without any indication that he needs air to live in the first place?! It was just plain stupid, a move to make the viewers feel bad for the little hero, when his death makes no sense!

"The Fundamentals of Math AND Philosophy: For anyone looking for an introduction to math, geometry more specifically, or philosophy at large, this is THE book, and in my estimation, THE edition to get. Heath is no fly-by-night pop-philosopher. His notes are almost as worthwhile as the text itself... a truly monumental feat.The rigors of geometry, the method of logic learned in these proofs, are one of the best ways to prepare the mind for real philosophy. Anyone can talk about the true and the good in a manner that inspires awe through vagueness and transcendent language, but that is a very different matter than the sort of philosophy that is built upon the real work of logic and hard-earned definitions.If you have any interest in the latter, I heartily commend this book to you.

"Vote For Stillson!...: What a movie! What a cast! David Cronenberg took King's classic tale of precognition and predestination and gave it his own personal bleak touch! Christopher Walken (Sleepy Hollow) is the perfect Johnny Smith, taken out of normality and plunged into a psychic nightmare world. His gift / curse enables him to see both past and future events, leading him ever closer to his final destiny. Martin Sheen (The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane) is excellent as the lizard-like senate candidate, Greg Stillson. Horror mistress, Brooke Adams (Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Shock Waves, Sometimes They Come Back) is Johnny's could / should-have-been ""wife"", unable to shake Johnny from her mind. Tom Skerritt (Alien) is the sheriff of Castlerock who seeks out Johnny in order to catch the infamous Castlerock killer. Herbert Lom (Asylum) is Johnny's doctor. Even Anthony Zerbe (The Omega Man) and Colleen Dewhurst (When A Stranger Calls) are along for this wild ride! Highly recommended...

"Don't walk across the football pitch in the dark...: This movie is in my personal top 10 - which just shows how much I enjoyed it. It may not be art, but by gum, it's cracking good fun. The comedy is suitably black and nasty, the tension is very palpable, and the concept - well, the concept may not be absolutely original (what is, these days?) but it is very good. I think very highly of it as an example of how good a horror movie should be, ironic, intelligent, sassy, smart and well-acted. The monsters are JUST this side of credible, which makes it all the more riveting. Last night, I was walking across three deserted football pitches on campus and suddenly remembered this movie - and had to keep reminding myself that it was JUST a movie. That is the sign of a successful ""beast"" horror movie. It relies upon common sense, a humourous screenplay, actors who do not ham any more than is necessary, and a general atmosphere of cracking good fun. Brilliant stuff.

"Laurel & Hardy Perils: The Further Perils of Laurel and HardyI received this item this week(March 7 2008) & it was one I did not know was avalable & saw thru a link. I have the other items in this Youngson series from other publishers late last year. This one is poor to, say the least, with faded & washed-out images although the sound is OK. The grain is very high and contrary to another review, PAL TV in Australia in the 1950s & 60s did not look anything as bad as the images in this DVD. The other Youngsons that came out last year were better although the highest priced one did leave a lot to be desired in picture quality also but not like the Further Perils. If only Warner bros would buy more of these things for extras on their great DVD releases then we would have restoration similar to what they have provided on at least one L&H; DVD set. But to have this title in the collection gets us to more completion of the Youngson compilations on DVD.

"There are none so blind then those who refuse to see!: Yes Mrs Pulling has done her best to caution others about ""breaking with reality"", and her book serves as an adequate example of what can happen when someone does become reality impared; it contains no real facts to support her claims that Dungeons and Drangons had any thing to do with any deaths what so ever, and what ""facts"" she does offer are either falsely described or out right lies. I agree that if you are a bad parent you should probably error on the side of caution and limit the activities of your little monster, but I think ""not keeping guns in the house"" and ""not letting your child butcher pets"" (both things Mrs Pulling admits she or her son did) should come well before stopping them from playing D&D.

The subtle and deliciously wicked scenarios that Edmund Dantes orchestrates to exact his revenge on his enemies are awe-inspiring and SOOOO entertaining. Although the 2002 Jim Caviezel movie is a great stand-alone film, it reveals so little of the subplots and supporting characters that you can dive into the book as if it's a brand new story and it really doesn't ruin either one. Please keep in mind that it IS a 19th century novel, so you'll have to wade through some serious romantic protestations, but they do not take away from the action. Definately worth reading...and FREE on Kindle. Thank you Kindle!

"Worth a second read.: I read and enjoyed this book as a youth. Later I read some of the Three Musketeers, was bored, and thought maybe Dumas had been a taste of adolescence. But the second time around, I found this story still a great read. Monte Cristo is not a study in psychology or culture: it is an amusement park ride before Disney, an Indiana Jones film in ink: a heck of a way to spend a rainy afternoon. (And make sure your plans for the evening are flexible.)The version I bought, Bantom, was too skinny, however. (Thus the missing star, also for typos.) Life is too short to read half of a masterpiece. Subvert the culture of instant gratification, and buy the unabridged version. Same goes for Hugo's Les Miserables, a similar bit of 19th Century French romanticism, even more rambling and magnificent in its un-cut version.

"Poor Quality: Let me be clear that I am a big fan of The Count of Monte Cristo, but don't spend your money on this copy. Visually, it's unappealing to the eyes (looks like a phone book). What is far worse, though, is that the editing in this book is horrendous. I will be half way through a sentence and the other half of it is starting a completely knew paragraph. There are spelling errors throughout the text. And what is really annoying is that the table of contents' page numbers don't match up with the text's page numbers. There's about a 50 page difference between the two. How that happened, I don't know. But, let me tell you that there are better unabridged copies of this excellent book out there.

"The Count of Monte Cristo: I first read this wonderful novel in high school. Interestingly, I read this book by personal selection and not by a Literature assignment. I remember it as the first book I loved. I am a voracious reader of reviews on Amazon and other sources. A recent review of this book reminded me that I should read it again. I'm enjoying it as much now as I did then.

"The Count of Monte Cristo: Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes.

"The Count of Monte Cristo (Oxford world Classics): Thoroughly entertaining and timeless read. Makes one reflect strongly on the emotions and ups and down of life. I wish I had realized the cross references were present at the end of the book as it may have clarified a few things. All in all I found it to be a book that I did not want to put down. I read reviews that recommended the unabridged versions and I am glad that I read it.

"Superb, but definitely a product of its time: Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read.

"Terrible, terrible edition: A wonderful classic story butchered by a senseless editor who removed major portions of the story without letting the reader know. The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there.

"This is one of the best movies from the late '80s: It's been close to twenty years since I watched this film. At first, it looks like an 80's attempt at a date movie, but this one goes much further than that. It has a captivating plot, likable characters, and one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Even though I'm not a fan of musicals or dancing, I still found myself enjoying this story. If you are a fan of Saturday Night Fever, you will most likely appreciate Dirty Dancing as well.

He does a great job balancing the up tempo songs and the ballads. The fast tracks make you wanna get up and dance and the slow ones make you wanna cry and just call that special someone in your life and just tell them ""I love you"". His voice is excellent on every track and most importantly.....the man lets you know what love is about. The jewels on this album are ""U remind me"", ""U got it bad"", ""Twork it out"", ""Can u help me"", ""If I want to"", ""Good ol' Ghetto"" and ""TTP"" (lol, basically every track on the album!). On a last note....those of you who know what good R&B music is, this album is a must, TRUST ME!!!

I know this is back in the day so I'll give her that much. But she was a little TOO hairy for me. This movie is really graphic and it shows a lot of uh..stuff. Ewan was so cute in it! But I think there could have been a better Nora picked. This is definitlely an erotic film like the actual overview says. the reason why i gave this film only 1 star is because it was so hard to follow! i figured out in the middle that time was jumping VERY fast. they should have dates as subtitles.

I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end?

That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake.

"The Greatest Novel Ever Written: Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more ""real"" than most people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out of the water. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You will NOT regret it.

I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me. Your mileage may vary...I won't be reading any of the remaining books.

The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed.

"Interesting continuation.: Like dune, it is flawed, spending too much time on internal monologue and exposition better left to the reader. Also like Dune, it is brilliant in many ways--symbolism, philosophy, intrigue, etc. I think one of the reasons that people didn't like it as much as Dune was because they were expecting more of the same and got, instead, a very changed universe (with several contradictions). Sequels in far-future sci fi always lack the wonder of discovering a new world; but in a way, watching the development is just as fascinating. If you liked Dune, read Dune Messiah.

"An over-rated piece of fiction: I had several close friends recommend Dune to me, all proclaiming how amazing it was as a novel, only to hear later that not one of them finished it for the same reason: ""it was kinda boring."" If you're asking yourself why someone would praise and recommend a book that they find to be boring then you're just as mystified as I am. I have yet to meet anyone who has read Dune who liked it or ever finished it.The books major problem is it has too many minor characters and very poor character development. The lead character, Paul, is a good example, as he has no personality, or any interesting qualities whatsoever. Sadly, all the characters are this way.I did finish this book, after forcing myself to keep reading for six months, and I will say that it eventually does get more interesting, but only in the last two chapters.

"Horribly Disappointing: First, I will be upfront: I didn't get very far in this movie. There are few movies that I will stop in the middle (in fact, I can't think of any), but this was one of them. I was very disappointed with this movie. It makes fun of Jane Austen. It criticizes everything about Jane Austen's time period. Everything in the movie seemed designed to mock, from the pond filled with scum in front of a great house to an unpolished mirror that could hardly be looked in to show the sisters reflections. It blatantly attacks Christianity ( or being faithful to your spouse before you ever even meet them, by keeping your wedding vows). As strange as it sounds, I felt like I was being attacked through the movie screen. It is a movie full of lies. Particularly the lie that by being faithful to your spouse you are missing out. The opposite is true. Hopefully, the movie improved by the end, but I couldn't make it that far to find out.

"Curl up and enjoy on a Rainy Day with a Cup of Tea.: If you remotely enjoy Jane Austin's works, this story is sure to please. Anne Hathaway is stunning and believable as Jane Austin. James McAvoy portrays young Jane's love interest and their chemistry is fantastic. Romantic, witty, Sad, funny, passionate - all things that make a great ""chick"" flick. You'll wish it wouldn't end. One word to the wise - Don't subject your husbands / boyfriends to this movie or you'll never hear the end of it.

"Contrived and so far from what we know about Jane Austen it is impossible to make the leap: This is no ""Mrs. Brown."" It is a fictitious assumption about Jane Austen and her paramours made into a romantic tale that hardly holds up with plot contrivances galore and the inevitable heartbreak. Watch it once then forget that you did. It is harmless.

"one word: unbelievable: this is truly the most compelling book on commercial office space that i have read, and i have read all of them. It is short,concsice and to the point.Tunis captures the essence of what it means to negotiate for a piece of space and delivers it in a way that the layman can understand even the more complex points. A one of a kind book that i would heartily recommend for anybody looking to get in the commercial real estate field or just searching for office space.

"Greaat Movie: This is a great movie!Its 1969. Alan Parish has troubles with his father. He finds a game named Jumanji at a construction site. He plays with his former friend Sarah Whiddle. They play, and until the game reads 5 or 8, in the jungle he must wait. The game isn't played until 26 years later by a young girl and boy that will be living in the Parish home. Peter, the young boy, rolls a 5, or 8, and he is unleashed. This wild movie is all in one day! It turns out they can not play until Sarah Whiddle joins. They find her and the whole town, including her try to believe it was the father that killed him. I hate to say it, but the ending is sad. Once they finish the game, it should all dissappear. Robin Williams isn't the only one relased from the game. Who else? Go buy it now!

"My Son's FAvorite: I did not see this movie in the theatre, but we rented it last year on video and really enjoyed it. Surprisingly, however, my 5-year-old son was wild about it! I had heard it was too scary for young kids, but he loved it. In fact, it has become one of his all time favorite movies, and we have rented it so many times (at his request) that we're going to buy the video for him for Christmas. The special effects in this movie are great, and (unlike the professional reviewers), I think the character development is fine. I think reviewers forget that sometimes people watch movies just for entertainment and fun!

"Jumanji is fun!: What a great movie and a clever concept! A board game that sucks you into it, and must be finished by the originals who played the game. I remember seeing Jumanji in the movie theatre when it first came out, and this past weekend had the opportunity to rewatch it (thank you resale DVDs!)Starring Robin Williams and Bonnie Hunt, the action is fast paced and easy to follow. No swearing in this movie makes it appropriate for all ages, though little ones might be frightened by the rampaging animals. There is nothing Disneylike in their qualities.Still, the story of sticking together and teamwork prevail throughout the entire film. Bebe Neuwirth and David Alan Greier are great in their supporting roles. Bonnie Hunt gets some of the best lines in the film with regards to cheating and a downtown sale. An early Kirstin Dunst is also great.If you have never seen Jumanji, I encourage you check it out. It's fun and you always wonder what the game is going to come up with next.

"Dangerous!: I have tried this item a few times and learned:The strainer top does not hold tight to the cooker, nor is there anything in the design of the cooker part to permit the strainer top to attach to it. This means that when you tip the cooker over to pour out the water, the top falls off! Danger of scalding and steam burns!It worked adequately for rice vermicelli, which one would normally just soak in boiling water anyway. When I tried it with penne, the pasta pieces on the bottom of the container didn't even get wet from the hot water, never mind cooked! I still had to remove the pasta at the end of the so-called cooking time, and transfer it to a pot of boiling water in order to get it cooked!This so-called pasta cooker is a waste of time. Not a waste of money if you want to have a plastic vase for long-stemmed flowers... that's what you can safely use it for!

"A Classic: This is a movie that my mother took me and my siblings to when it first came out. I remember loving the title and thinking it would be really scary since it was about murder and death. What I remember most about it is Maggie Smith saying, ""Dickie! Where's my Dickie?!"" I bought it for sentimental reasons. It's a really great movie, if only for all the stars that appear. It's also got Truman Capote, who is strange and wonderful. It's got lots of twists and turn. The introduction is a little long - the piece where everyone arrives at the mansion. It's a little gimicky, but it's Neil Simon, so that's to be expected. Would I recommend it to others? Sure. Was I a tiny bit disappointed that it was not as wonderful as I remember it? Sure. The last thirty years made it a little better in my mind than it actually is. It's got some good extras, but not as many as I generally like. But it's a good nostalgia pick and there are some great performances.

"Great comedy from before foul language: This movie has always been a favorite of mine. I originally saw it when it came out, and remember all the crazy stuff that went on. Later it became a thing where we would rent it every so often and watch it, waiting for certain parts. It draws on a great cast, a strange script, and sets that fit the storys mood. Its a film that would never be made today because they would never bring in so many great actors, and hire a top notch screenplay writer. Its easier now to just get one known actor, or a script that relies on foul language and gross jokes with whoever starring in it. I enjoy that type of movie too, but this is not like that. This is a fun movie, thats the best way to describe it.

"Pathetic Attempt at Bond: This film is awful. The plot is a twisted Bond-film scenario with only difference being that Disel isn't a professional spy, but recruited by the US Government because he appears to be tough and, at the same time, a criminal. The special effects were okay, but very predictable and hardly believable. The film also had some lines from previous Bond films, and even some screen shots that looked awfully similar to some of the past Bond movies. But Diesel is no Bond. He ... as a spy, and is an awkward actor at that.

"Big Disappointment: Anyone who saw the stage production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR RAINCOAT must be disappointed by the movie. The main problem is the staging of it as a play at a school, resulting in unrealistic and cutesy scenes of kids worshipfully smiling at singing adults.

"Can we say ""overproduced""?: I agree wholeheartedly with Donald-from-Ohio's review. I've been a fan of this Lloyd Weber/Rice musical for 20+ years and have seen it grow as songs were added and various recordings made available. Having never had the opportunity to see the stage production, I was eager to see this video. Now I realize that perhaps this musical is one to be heard and not seen, at least not beyond an unpretentious summer camp or youth group presentation, the perfect venues for this show. Yes, Osmond performs nicely in the role of Joseph. But everything else about this production is so overdone that watching it, for me, is like seeing a favorite childhood friend grow up to become a cheap circus performer. The two stars I give this video are for the music itself. But I certainly don't understand why Lloyd Weber chose to add the FINALE song ""Any Dream Will Do"" to the BEGINNING of the show.

I thought it was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen on 'Great Performances', apart from 'Cats' of course. If I could give it higher then 5 stars, I would. Though the Mrs. Potiphar's scene I have to admit was a little on the personal side, it didn't really show anything. Her servents costumes were NOT see through, they were just white mesh with extremly small holes between the fabric thread. I would recomond this to anyone that wants to watch and listen to a really upbeat musical that you just have to get up and dance to.

They insisted I buy the soundtrack CD (also an awesome thing to have), and now my three year old bops around the house singing, ""Go, go, go Joseph!"" Good music, great lyrics, a great evening for the entire family! A must for Andrew Lloyd Weber fans of all ages.

"Eye-opening version... Re-orchestrated?: This is a superb visualisation of the show based on the early 90's London Revival with Jason Donovan and (subsequently) Philip Schofield. The production was then moved to the US where Donny Osmond took the title role for 6 or 7 years. This version owes a lot to the original London Revival production. The Canaan sets and the Pharoah sets are practically identical to those of the stage version, just fleshed out a bit. The jail and Potiphar's offices are a new departure, with a triangular theme in black, white and silver. What impressed me the most, though, was the huge involvement of the chorus in this production. The chorus work also seems to have been augmented, with additional harmony lines and dances. All in all, a reaffirmation of the stage as a medium, even in video form! Enjoy!

"Amazing Things About Joseph: This movie was amazing! I've seen the play and own the CD, and this was by far better. The cast has so much fun with their roles that the audience can't help but enjoy the performance. Donnie Osmond was made for this role, and Maria Friedman shines as the Narrator. I saw another review that said this was racy and distasteful for children, but I found it no more inappropriate than the live performance, and the scenes in question are over so fast, children will hardly have time to question it. I think it's great for the whole family, musical-lovers and nonmusical-lovers alike! I expected it to be the taping of a live performance, and was dreading the poor quality that is unavoidable in such cases, like extreme facial closeups, and bad lighting. What a surprise this was! It was nothing like I expected, and better than I hoped!

"Buy the soundtrack instead.: Joseph lovers; you will be disappointed with this film. Family viewing it is not. Potiphar's wife and her servants are definitely R rated, and you may be embarrassed to watch this with your children. The narrator is breathy and sexy, which may work in some venues, but not when she is narrating a Bible story to a grade school assembly. Rent it and get it over with, but you'll probably grate at the slow musical pace.

"A must have for aspiring colorists and lettering: This is by far the most informative book I have come across for lettering and coloring comics. it gives you step by step instructions on how to scan your art, prep it in photoshop, color it, letter it and finally the clean up process. heck, it even goes into how to submit it to the publisher. it also gives non step by step info on things such as color theory and the use of photoshop filters. WAY better than any Marvel book i've read so far.

"Okay but short of expectations: I got this book to accelerate my knowledge, but I decided that it s not as good as other books of the same kind. Namely, Hi-Fi Guide to coloring Comics, and the lettering book by Comicraft. I got this book because its a book about DC comics, my personal favorites, and I thought I would get better direction on how to ""do these things like they do"" Sadly this just isnt the case. The direction is just a skimming off the top and gives great history, but actually I have yet to find anything helpful in it. The Comicraft lettering book gives you step by step in Illustrator; and once you learn it it sticks in your mind. Simple as that. The hi fi book, gives instruction and comes with hady texture maps to give your colors more appeal. I would probably recommend this book to younger artists 14 and below. Maybe this was the age bracket it was intended for?

"Much Respect: If you thought Bleed's debut was hot, your gonna get roasted to this. ""My Own"" has a different sound than his first record, but that's what makes it great. He uses lots of samples from the 70's giving it southernplayalistic style that's unmatched. The message conveyed through his lyrics is more than just a mission about money and cheese and thuggin'. Ghetto celebrities Too Short and Daz found their way onto this record, but they are an afterthought. The narcotic effect of Bleed's southern drawl and story telling ability that spawned his first record just accelerates on My Own.

"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Blu-ray): I was very excited to see that the movie arrived within a couple of days of purchase. However, I was not able to watch the movie for almost a month later due to our remodling of our living room witch houses our surround sound and tv. The blu-ray is just a copy of the dvd that came out a few years ago, but I was fine with that since I did not own the dvd. The movie was awesome and still scary just as i remembered it since i last saw it when i was a teen. To my great excitement came sadness when I wanted to see the special features and they did not work!!!!! I cliked on them over and over and nothing, it just brought me back to the main screen again and again. I don't know if this has happened to anybody else, or is my copy a dud.

"THIS is horror!: No matter how many times I've watched this movie, I'm scared sh**less. I love movies that can scare me even after watching them a million times.Watching all the extras on the DVD didn't help, either. I watched all the Deleted Scenes, the Bloopers, even put an alternative soundtrack on the movie (with Gunnar Hanson, Tobe Hooper, and a production designer narrating) and it still scares me.Oh, I can handle my horror but The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of those films that stays with you and refuses to leave. Today's sick jokes of horror films have nothing on Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven, Dario Argento, or the rest of the horror masters.

"Absolutely terrifying: I skipped this one during its drive-in days, but I caught up with it on video in the 80s. I was so primed to be scared that I watched it on a sunny Saturday afternoon with all the lights on. And it STILL scared the bejesus out of me. You'd be surprised by how little gore there actually is and by how willing Hooper is to sustain the length of a scene until you think you'll leap out of your skin with anxiety. The final shot against the rising sun is maybe my pick for the most memorable of any horror film. It seemed to sum up everything that went before plus make you (a) rethink it while you're (b) not sleeping that night.

"Good, but sometimes disturbing: THIS is a HORROR movie. In the same vein as ""Last house on the left"". Well directed and not for sissy horror fans that think ""Scream"" is the first slasher film. Yeah thats a ""good"" movie.

"The Greatest Horror film of all time !: Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark masterpiece debut ""THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" is by far the single most influential horror film of all time. This is the holy grail of horror movies! When i was a kid this movie changed my life,i've been a horror movie addict ever since! This film is the ultimate blue-print on how to make a great horror movie. There are many films that contain much more blood & gore then T.C.M. & to the eye of the beholder there may even be films out there that are more scary then T.C.M.(maybe!?!?) but what makes this film numero uno of all horror films is simpley the amount of influence it has contributed to the horror world & its this reason & this reason alone that ""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE"" is the best there was,the best there is & the best there ever will be!

"Mt Great-Great Uncle: I only bought this because my Great-great uncle, Ross Santee, was featured in it for about 15 seconds. The video was made in 1939, when color had just come out, and the quality of the color is awful. Shadows in people's faces are green. The story line is so basic any kid could predict the ending. Still, it was well worth $10 for me to have a tiny bit of memorabilia of my long-distant family member.

"Despite great acting by De Niro, this movie sucks.: Let me start by saying that I had high hopes for this film. Some people praise it like it's as good as Taxi Driver. After watching it though, I have no clue what people see in this movie. It drags on and on and at some points of the film (espcially the middle) you really have no idea what is going on anymore. I almost felt like shutting it off a few times, but luckily De Niro's acting kept me from hitting the stop button.I'm sure when this movie came out it was shocking and disturbing, since there wasn't much like it back then. However, by today's standards it really falls flat on it's face. I would not recommend this film to anyone, although if you're really curious about it feel free to give it a try. Obviously there are those who like really bizarre pointless movies like this. Just don't say I didn't warn you!

"All Star Cast.....But...: I saw this movie in my local video store, and I got excited. I saw huge names (Keitel, De Niro, Scorsese, what would YOU expect?) So I got home, called a couple of friends over, and we sat and watched this movie.This was possibly the most disappointing movie of all time. I'm not kidding at all. I seriously felt dumber after watching this movie; there was absolutely no plot. I don't know how all these people are prancing around calling it ""one of the greatest hits of the '70s!"" No.Keep in mind, I'm a HUGE Keitel, as well as De Niro fan. I was so disappointed with this movie; but the problem was, there was absolutely no plot, and no transition. The actors played their characters well, but there was no room for characters in the movie. It was a huge upset; 'travesty' does not do this movie justice. No plot, no culmination, no action, no transition, no STORY. Period.

"this is not a good movie: If your a die hard fan and saw them all, you may like it, otherwise be warned. It's not good, the twisting of reality with Robert Englund appearing as himself, and Wes Craven's cameo just didn't add the renewal of life that they had hoped. It's not really scary either, which I thought was kind of a requirement in these horror movies.

"What was the point of this????: Talk about beating a dead horse. How much further can the Freddy thing get stretched? The idea of a character from the movies 'becoming real because he was so evil' is ludicrous at best. It would be like walking into 7-11 and bumping into Darth Vadar as you were filling up your Big Gulp.

I love the return of the original cast members,i love the Freddy character in this movie more than i have since Part 4 because he's actually kind of frigtening again,and i think that the story is well executed.

Maybe i'm misintrepreting, but i saw this movie when i was nine, four years ago, and i recall Dylan sleepwalking into the middle of the street on his way home from the hospital, and Kreuger grabbing him from the sky.

"If this CD doesn't perk you up, you're dead: A fun CD from beginning to end. Starts out with the radio hit ""Zoot Suit Riot"", a very catchy tune with plenty of brasswork that doesn't sound too serious or too contrived. The lyrics reflect the swing-era roots but contain modern phrases and topics (some a little risque). Very tight execution of the genre, every song has a little hook or element that is straight from the swing era. The lyrics are clever and descriptive with a lot of detail. A good CD for either serious headphone listening or to just put on in the background.

On stage, I have never seen a band more charged and on fire than the CPD's. All other swing is boring lounge music compared to Zoot Suit. Steve Perry is one of the top three lyric writers on my personal list, making their music all the more enjoyable. The lyrics are complex, intelligent, morally pointed, and clever. The music is rich, catchy, diverse, and incorporates more instruments than other swing bands. The CPD's are definitely not smooth and syrupy like other bland bands. They have the same demented, spastic gusto they started out with years ago, and are only going to get hotter. All other bands, including the ""masters"" of days-gone-by swing (with all due respect, of course), are left foundering in the wake of the CPD's.

Thompson is a talented musician and the fact that he had been diagnosed with Lou Gherig's disease by the time of the recording (something I found out after hearing the CD) just made it that much more poignant.

I first noticed a problem when the first spider dies in the movie, and there is no vortex sound effect. Then the entire scene in Lake Town is... muted. The arrows are silenced, the dragon roars as a mouse, and the fire, it crackles as a loud annoyance. I wish I had read the reviews online prior to purchasing, now I am stuck with a poor quality DVD. I will be buying the VHS shortly.

"The DVD sound is TOTALLY unacceptable: The DVD omits _all_ ambient noise in the movie, including Smaug's fire, his whooshing noise over the village, the arrows plinking, wolves howling, etc. It is very disturbing to those who are familiar with the video version, and if I could I would ask for my money back.

"MOIVES ON PARADE! DO NOT ORDER-ITS WORST COPY OF HOBBIT: I have seen this moive over 1000 times and thats no exageration! being born in 1972 I remember this film in the theatres and has been a favorite ever since and is a FAMILY FAVORITE with my kids today.This ""THE HOBBIT:THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED 1977 ANIMATED CLASSIC"" as advertised it a complete lie, the film is edited and missing scences,not whole scences mind but enough to make it seem it was chopped to be compadible for T.V. and its commercials to fit in a time slot, not only that the colar is quite faded and not sure if it is due to a poor quality DVD that the moive was downloaded/recorded on but there is a glich, a repeator skip of 1.5 second as Bilbo spaeks to Gandalf and others....I will never order on Amazon again, HOW CAN THEY CALL IT THE ORIGINAL UNEDITED CLASSIC WHEN IT IS NOT!SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR THE REAL VERSION!!!

"Great version of J.R.R. Tolkein's The Hobbit.: Bilbo Baggins ( voiced by "" Orson Bean"") is a Hobbit that goes on a simple quest with Gandolf ( John Huston) and a bunch of Dwarfs that must find Gold from the evil Dragon "" Smaug"". A highly entertaining and all-around fun yet excellent Rankin-Bassfilm which is one of the best they did with "" Return of the King"", "" The Last Unicorn"", and "" Flight of Dragons"".Also recommend: Lord of the Rings ( 1978), Return of the King,and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings.

"TERRIBLE DVD Sound - Avoid the DVD!!: Whether you like the original movie or not, the DVD version's soundtrack is missing a very large number of key elements - the majority of the sound effects, ambient sound backgrounds, some of the music, and even the occaisional bit of dialogue. The result is like watching an unfinished movie with a ""temp"" audio track. A truly horrendous offense for an animated movie, which depends so much on sound. Do NOT buy the DVD - you're not really getting the movie as advertised.

"Disappointed...: What a bummer. First off, it was late getting here even though it was sent 2-day Prime. So it barely made it for Christmas. The worst part is the poor quality of the DVD. It skipped in SEVERAL places. Brand new out of the case, first time in the player, and it skipped. The quality of the movie is awful too. You'd think if it was that bad to begin with, it wouldn't have been transferred to a DVD to begin with... :/

"A review- post viewing of the Hobbit: Overall, it was great. I, being a hardcore Tolkien fan, judged the movie with an extremely critical eye. The songs were well done. And the animation was o.k. It really only has one plot conflict,that being that they totally left out Beorn. Oh, yeah , the elves could have been portrayed better. They look like blue ants that got tangled up in the machinery of a textile mill. Gollum was wonderful.

"Terrible DVD Transfer: My experience has been in line with several others here. Sounds are missing from the original version, some sounds repeat. There are several points where the DVD appears to skip and replay a short sequence that it just played. The colors are extremely poor -the cave scenes are supposed to be darker but here we struggled to actually see anything that was happening. I like the film, but the quality of this transfer is just unacceptable - do not buy.

"Unwatchable!: The animated Hobbit has for years been one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately, the quality of this DVD is similar to what you would get if you copied a worn VHS tape onto a disk. The movie is so dark in many places you can only see dim shapes moving about. The theme song even has a skip in it and there are a number of other skips in the soundtrack. There are also several places where a second or so of the movie is duplicated and repeated. I have no idea how they messed that up! If i had purchased it locally, i would return it, but i guess i will keep it until they decide to fix this dvd and reissue it, hopefully on a blu-ray. My recommendation is Do Not Purchase this version unless you really cannot live without a copy, any copy.

I could not read the even smaller footnotes.I measured the capital letters and found them to be 0.090 inch high. According to Wikipedia the current font standard is 1 point = 1/72 inch. That should make a 9 point font 0.125 inch high. Even the old font standard has the 9 point font in the 0.125 inch range.Other than the font the Bible seems to have good quality. Use of the very large margins should allow the publisher to use a full 9 point font without increasing the page count.The Bible was promptly returned.

"This film had a point to make, but we lose interest right..: from the beginning. Because the film is so boring, we don't really care to know what the point was.ASH WEDNESDAY is about a middle-aged woman, who is undergoing a middle-age crisis, elememts of which include her having an extensive plastic surgery and a young lover. It is a ""we have to value what we've got"" sort of thing.Except for the great Henry Fonda, who appears only in couple of scenes, all actors are complete ham. I did not feel any genuine emotion coming from the screen, I didn't laugh, and I was not entertained. On my list, these are the characteristics of a bad movie. I am sorry to hurt the feelings of all die-hard Elizabeth Taylor fans: she is a true star, but even her costumes could not save this film. It is dull and pretentious!

"Can I give it 10 STARS? Repin' HARLEM to the Fullest: This is a remarkable book. Mr.Thomas you did your thang! This is the first real grown- up book I read back in 1995. I was sooo open I wanted to know everything that happened next. Piri was Wild! And knowing that this is an autobiography it's even more exciting. I love the way he represented the areas I've lived in or even went to school in. Piri told life how it really was and how it took him to learn about it. Growing up in Spanish Harlem put me on to a lot of Hispanics denying their African culture. It's true how some parents like Piri had act the same way as they did.I had the pleasure of meeting Piri Thomas at my school in Spanish Harlem also it was remarkable to picture such a character then really see him face to face although he was much much older. But it was still amazing. This book is Raw and it an absolute page turner let me tell you from a young Black teenager in Harlem THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK, AN ABSOLUTE PAGE TURNER!

"Encounter With Alien Man: I would not recommend ""Space Aliens Took Me To Their Planet"" to those who disbelieve that the earth is being visited by spaceships (piloted by god-like people) because this book depicts such an encounter that took place in 1973 in France. ======= The book's emphasis is upon the alien's extensive message concerning mankind's origins, mankind's religions, mankind's future, etc. ======= If I were to only judge the insights that this book provides into the awesome technology and power exhibited by aliens, a well as the awesome influence that aliens can wield upon human beings, I would have to give the highest rating available (five stars). However, I will only give this book one star because another book, entitled ""The Sacred And The Profane"", written by Desiree Ntolo (published in 2008 and available from Amazon.com), exposes the dangerously evil intentions that form the basis of the alien's message.

"Not True to History or Joan of Arc: Save your time and money - avoid this movie.I have studied the life of Joan of Arc and was extremely disappointed by this movie. The Messenger portrays Joan as a mental case who was unsure of herself and full of doubts. The record is clear that the real Joan was confident in her faith and in ""her voices.""Also the movie has many scenes of graphic violence that are purely gratuitous and unnecessary. Yes war is violent but to include scenes of a head exploded by a giant wreaking ball adds nothing.I do not recommend this movie to anyone who is serious about learning about Joan of Arc.Get the 1948 Ingrid Bergman movie - it is much closer to the true story.For the best version of the real story, read Mark Twain's book.This movie is an insult to a young woman who is quite possibly the most remarkable person who ever lived (aside from Jesus).

"Gripping account of long-lasting effects of killing spree.: Author Greg Kelly was 10 years old growing up in Rockford, Ill., when Ray Lee Stewart went on a weeklong killing spree that took 6 lives and shook the community's small-town midwestern roots. Like so many others in Rockford, Greg was terrified until long after Stewart's capture and haunted by his crimes for years afterwards. Fifteen years later as a young newsman working at WGN Television in Chicago, Greg called in sick so he could attend the murderer's clemency hearing. A few weeks later he witnessed the execution. Kelly's vivid description of that eerie evening is alone worth the price of the book, as are the insights into courtroom proceedings, TV reporting, and Kelly's portraits of victims' families and their suffering.

We receive a good number of thunderstorms in our area so the audible alert can be a hassle. But the fact I can set it to only alert visually is great. We have a vacation home so I add the county number for that location when we are there. Most of those alerts are snow related and it really saved me once because we don't receive local stations there and a big snowstorm popped up out of the bright blue sky.I originally gave it five stars but knocked it down because of the user interface. I'm a techie and I can pick up an object I have not touched in a while and operate it. However, I always forget how to add a county number and it takes me a few minutes to figure it out. Maybe they have already improved it since mine is so old.

"Great radio! Nearly invisible instructions!: The OS WR 102 is a terrific radio, especially considering the price here on Amazon. It is essential to have a reliable weather radio since mid-Mississippi is subject to killer tornadoes and fearsome thunderstorms. I will certainly feel safer with this one close by.My only complaint: the instruction sheet is printed in a typeface so small I had to enlarge it on a copy machine in order to read it. While the instructions are clear, the layout is sensible, and the programming relatively simple, trying to decipher 4-point type made the whole experience needlessly frustrating. C'mon, guys! Your radio is a really good one! Why diminish a fine product with nearly invisible -- and thereby unreadable -- instructions!?

"Disapointed: I was never really able to get this unit working. After thinking I had installed weak batteries, I discovered that the only way to keep the unit powered was to apply pressure to the battery cover compartment. Additionally, I found installing batteries annoying due to a very thin peice of weather stripping that easily falls out of place and is not amenable to being replaced. I returned this item.

"Sealy Best Fit 330-Thread Count Cotton Sateen Sheet Set: Purchased this set of sheets on April 16, 2011, only two months ago. The fitted sheet have started piling, which indicates not a good quality set of sheets. The only thing that I loved about these sheets is the fitted sheet and how it hugs the mattress. For the price of these sheets the quality is just not there. The sheets that these replace were 5 years old and just started ripping, two months is unacceptable.Sincerely,Jody M Becnel

"OUCH!: First of all I must agree that these are the best fitting sheets you may ever find in your life. BUT, unless you love sleeping on the beach with nothing between you and clumpy, gritty sand, don't buy them. After several washings the fabric is truly so rough that it hurts. There is a fatal flaw- the fabric- and the manufacturer must change it if it wants repeat customers. Summary: fit is fantastic, sheets are terrible. Don't buy them.

"Vague advice: I bought this book just before marrying a man with four children from his first marriage. I expected solid examples of stepmoms overcoming obstacles and sharing their wisdom. However, I found the book very frustrating: 1)the testimonials all came from women who were dissatisfied with their relationships, neglecting those who developed strong bonds with stepchildren; 2)the advice is all too vague to be applied. Chapters titled, ""Simplify Expectations"" and ""Simplify Relationships"" are filled with generalizations that are about as effective as telling an over-stressed mom to ""just relax"". Overall, a disappointing read.

"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court: I thought that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court By Mark Twain touched a lot of important aspects that our culture and society faces today while also satirized the times of Camelot. It also contrasted and showed the differences between the medieval times and the nineteenth century.But unfortunately I found this book hard to follow and had trouble getting into it. I felt that Twain often drug on certain topics or ideas. I think that I would have found this book to be a lot more interesting if Twain would have been more forward and to the point. I guess this book just wasn't for me, but others might find it interesting.But I do have a lot of respect for Twain for writing this. I'm sure that this book caused a lot of controversy since he wrote about a lot of sensitive topics, especially earlier in his time.
",1,1
"A Great Satire in the form of a Great work of Literature: Mark Twain is no Science-Fiction author, but he makes this a good story anyway. He sends a mechanical genius back to the time of King Arthur to take a look back at America. Because of his knowledge, the narrarator becomes the King's right-hand man, the second most powerful man in England, known as The Boss. He begins to establish a more advanced society underground to gaurd against the Church. Over many years, he learns to adjust to the society and becomes respected world-wide due to his ""magic."" Unforetunately this results in making Merlin his great advisary. The Boss goes on many adventures and gets involved in many predicaments, each time surviving by his wit and knowledge. A wonderfully told tale that examines America's faults by looking at them from 7 centuries before. Unfortunately Twain, once again, falls short on his ending and leaves the reader mildly entertained, but not better off.

"A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes: Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan, 1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent.

"What a disappointment.: My son's two favorite things in the world: 1. Little Einsteins, 2. Space. He went crazy when he saw the commercial for this new DVD. We, too, pre-ordered the movie and counted down the days until its release. And we, too, were bitterly disappointed by its contents. As the other reviewers have said, it is not a movie, and it is not about space. I would think that if Disney were going to release a space-themed DVD containing old episodes, they would at least include Galactic Goodnight. At least that one actually talked about the planets. I would not have purchased this if I would have been able to preview it before buying. :(

This flashlight is better than the 'fake' shake flashlight we'd previously ordered for $2.35 at amazon.com, because it actually uses a real NIB magnet and appropriate circuitry. However, the reed switch (which uses a small magnet to connect the capacitor's stored potential to the LED)doesn't work. Thus, the LED won't light. I'm very disappointed with this purchase. There are genuienly amazing shake flashlights that, both in function and design are truly brilliant devices, but they cost a lot more than this flashlight, so it seems that the old saying, ""you get what you pay for"", is proven true, once again.

Carey doesn't rely as much on the bar to jar the reader in and out of the story and it's stronger for that. She gives Janeway her own unique voice and makes reading the book a pure pleasure. My only gripe is that Carey's love of sailing shows through far too many times and is getting a bit tedious since it's been the focus of her past several Trek yarns. But otherwise, an enjoyably pleasant book.

I felt the movie bored me, offered nothing and basically wasted my time and money.If you want a ""good"" zombie movie, I don't think this is it.

"Oh, yeah! The ""Coriolanus effect""!: This one isn't really ""science fiction,"" since, with only changes, it could be set in the here-and-now, or in Ruritania -- but it's pure Heinlein, and better written than many of his earlier works. At only 128 pages, it's also pretty short for a novel -- but it works. Lorenzo Smyth (a/k/a Larry Smith) is an actor convinced of his own talent (which, as it turns out, is actually considerable) who is hired to impersonate the Good Guy leader of a major political alliance, who has been kidnaped on Mars by the Evil Opposition. Against his better apolitical judgment, Lorenzo takes the job because it's a challenge, and almost immediately regrets it as the limited engagement spins itself out indefinitely. There's a minimum of strident overwriting of the sort Heinlein was often guilty of in pursuit of his moral and ethical positions, with the quietly-made exception of a plea for racial tolerance.

"Disappointing: This is the third installment in a series of dramatizations of Lucy Maud Montgomery's beloved Anne of Green Gables novels. Megan Follows and Jonathon Crombie return in their usual roles. Unfortunately, this third production does not meet the high standards set by the first, faithful installment. In a total of seven Anne novels, Montgomery provided fully enough amusing, sentimental, and unabashedly romantic material for three movies. It was a pity that the second production (Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel) departed somewhat from the novels; it's a crime that this third production leaves Montgomery behind entirely, transporting her characters forward in time, pitchforking them into a trite war plot, and resolving the incoherent plot elements with a tepid, candy-coated ending.

The anti-American sediment found throughout the movie is something that I took to heart and I belive that Kevin Sullivan did a wonderful job at alienating much of his audience by the thoughtless comments made in this film.

(How could they do that!). I wish I'd never watched this, as its ruined the way I imagined Anne and the others to have lived, happily ever after is what I expected.

"Soooooo disappointed: I was so happy when I borrowed this movie from our local library. Now I'm only happy that I borrowed it instead of purchasing it. The books were , basically, thrown out when this movie was made. I was so disappointed. I will not watch this sequel again. If you really liked the first two movies, I would not bother to watch the 3rd. It left me feeling sick to my stomach at such a gross departure from the books and story line.

"Don't do it!!!!: The first two are wonderful but don't waste your time or money on the Continuing Story. It is awful, isn't even similar to the books and she does very un-Anne like things. Not worth it at all and very disappointing!

"Has NOTHING in common with the Books!!!!: There is nothing---and I mean truly NOTHING---in common between the ""Anne books"" and this movie! It's quite horrible in every way. I wish I could give it negative stars! Yes, the second mini-series of this trilogy takes frequent license, but it retains enough episodes and character of the book to be quite enjoyable in it's own way. THIS little ""thing"" simply keeps a few character names, retains several original actors, and truly and completely makes up a story out of whole cloth. If they were in such an itch to make a WWI ""Anne,"" they could (and should) have made 'Rilla. But they made this atrocity instead. If you have ANY respect for the book, please just forget this movie exists. Hideous!

This is the perfect book to share with a friend having a bad day--I've turned many a friend's tears of frustration into tears of laughter with a mere flip of the page. It's also the ideal book to share with each other to make a good day even better.If these crazy little chicks could talk, they'd make great guests on Oprah.

"Very good!!!: Is it just me or does anybody else notice that the production standards on this disc aren't up to those of his other recordings? Play this album back to back with So and you will notice that the sound on So is much crisper and cleaner. Anyway, the musical content on this album is right up there with So and in some instances surpasses it. Oh sure, there are the obligatory ""I'm only putting this tune on the disc in hopes that I'll get radio airplay"" songs Steam and Kiss that Frog in which he tries to repeat the success of ""Sledgehammer"". Otherwise the songs on Us are some of the best that PG's ever done either lyrically or musically. Even the early nineties hit ""Digging in the Dirt"" is a pretty complex look into the psyche. If you like So, you'll be pleasantly surprised by Us. And BTW, if you like Us, check out Plus From Us which is a compilation of music from the musicians which appeared on, and inspired the music of, Us.

"Spend a little more and get a better router: I have owned and have friends that own different routers then this one and none are as bad. Two major problems with this router:1. Wireless range is BAD (I own a cheap router and it has twice the range)2. Router loves to disconnect from the internet when multiple PC's are accessing the internet at once.I have the latest firmware which states it addresses the disconnect problem but doesn't. Hopefully they will come out with a new version soon!

"Easy setup, poor range: I bought this unit after my Linksys wireless router died; I can therefore only compare it to the Linksys.Setup was EXTREMELY quick and easy. I got it up and running in just a few minutes. The UI of the admin app is very straight forward and I notice is strangely similar to the UI of SMC routers. I find it to be somewhat easier to work with than the Linksys UI.I am unfortunately not pleased with the transmission range of this router. I placed it in the exact same location that the Linksys had been in. A computer that was getting solid 100% connection strength with the Linksys is now only getting 50% with this unit. Another machine that was getting around 70% on the Linksys would not connect at all to this unit until it was moved to a different location.This would be an excellent unit were it not for the range problem... Perhaps there's a fix?

"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!: From the first day I bought this product it had problems.....I called my service provider and we established that my connection is fine.....its definitely the router!! I called Belkin tech support and they tried to sell me service support in order to fix my problem!!! I managed to fix the problem for a few weeks but it RETURNED!! The thing keeps losing connection and i have to unplug and replug the darn thing to get it going again!! Its a pain! i wish i had spent a few dollars more and got a decent router!!

"Repeatedly Hangs: This router has good functionality and ease of use, but reliability is more important for me and this router hangs about once a day, so I'm giving it 1 star. You need to unplug the power cord and plug it back in every time to get it to work again.The range is a bit disappointing, too. About 30ft indoors.On the plus side, 128bit WEP and ability to limit access by MAC address are nice, and it's very easy to set up.Reading around some forums makes me think that the hanging problem is not universal, so if you're lucky enough to get one that works, it's not a bad router if you don't need long range wireless.For me, I'm returning it for a refund.

"Good Solid Cordless Phone: I was very surprised to see ony two stars for this phone. I have had one for over two years and this phone has been a good solid performer. I am a self-proclaimed gadget freak and have tried many different cordless phone brands. I think that Panasonic and Sony make the best phone and I think that Panasonic, while the cheaper of the two generally makes better equipment. With two small kids ours has been dropped and moved multiple times and has never given us trouble. It has provided better clarity than my more expensive Sony phones as well. I will admit that the features that are jammed into this phone are a bit over the top but this is a very useful phone. In fact, I'm on the site to purchase one for my mom. Happy Holiday!

"Amazing set of cookware!: Its been a very long time since I reviewed anything...but this set deserves my time to review. Though I bought this set elsewhere, I bought other pieces from amazon with the 4-for-3 offer to complete the set. I cook twice everyday and I have to say, Ive loved cooking with these pots! The 8 qt stockpot that comes with the set is what I use very sparingly, given its size...making it slightly unuseable for my small family of 4. Otherwise I got the 3.5 qt casserole, 2 qt & 3 qt. saucepans. I also got a 6 qt stockpot and pretty much those cover all my cooking needs. Very heavy and will certainly last a lifetime. I havent cooked with All-clad yet, so I cant comment if this set is comparable, but All-clad is definitely in my list :)

"Is Good: Yet another live Stones album, but it's good. Like most live albums from these guys, you get a combination of spendidly done covers (by the world's most underrated cover band) and Stones standards. My favorites are: the grinding rendition of Street Fighting Man, the fresh delivery of Shine A Light, and the must-have pairing of iconic band with iconic title on Like A Rolling Stone. If you are looking at this with any consideration at all, go ahead - you can't lose. This also comes with the reassurance that even though this band really hasn't given us much new worth listening to in about 25 years, at least they haven't lost their ability to put it out on stage (at least, as of the mid-90's when this was done).

"Possibly Gabriel's best solo work: I was surprised to see some relatively-negative comments directed towards PG's second solo album. I recently re-visited this album after many years, and found that while some of the more popular albums (#3 and Security) have not aged particularly well, this one stands the test of time. I would rate this as PG's best solo album (or at least my favorite). Not as pretentious as the albums that followed it, but darkly moving.

"Fantastic SACD: This was never advertised as a multi-channel SACD and I am glad that they didn't try to reformat it. The definitive edition of Peter Gabriel's work is all on SACD now and are must-haves for any fan with an SACD player. What many people do not realize about SACD is that the sampling rate is 2.8 MILLION samples-per-second as opposed to a normal CD which is only 44.1 THOUSAND sps. It is as close to an analog stream that you can get.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. If you don't have a good ear for audio and a good stereo system to listen to high-definition audio on then obviously you will not hear the difference. But for Audiophiles? A dream come true.

It is interesting to hear them play ""Start Me Up"" as it is was a new song at the time and they hadn't yet played it a million times. ""Shattered"" and ""Just My Imagination"" are roaring and their version of The Miracles ""Going To A Go-Go"" is a crowd pleaser. ""Under My Thumb"" is another very strong cut and it has a unusual, but perfectly fitting, intro with Duke Ellington's ""Take The 'A' Train"". Still Life shows the band at the peak of their concert playing, where the songs still sound fresh and haven't become old warhorses.

We play one-person ""Mahjong"" very often here (maybe too often?) and everyone from the adults to the 8 year old is hooked on this particular game. There's a two person version as well, but it's not as big of hit in our household. The graphics on the tiles are detailed, so this may not be a game for laptop size screens, but works just fine on regular larger monitors. You've also got the option to choose different tile graphics and layouts, which might help. One reason we purchased it is so that it could be played both on the Mac and the MS PC and it does that well. It has some fun sounds as the tiles are matched and removed. If you have the CD in, you get the sounds. Without the CD, no cute sounds, but the game goes faster, so it depends on what you want. I like the quality, the flexibility, and the challenge of the Mahjong game offered in this CD.

Sometimes it took several tries to win a game, but this is gone now; you can't try again. I re-installed the old version from 1988 (One 1.4MB diskette) and find it better than the current version. Any owner of the old DOS version who buys this version will be severely disappointed; you spent money to downgrade to an inferior product.

"Read the books...skip the movie.: I love Louis L'Amour, especially his epic series: The Sacketts. The stories are believable, tautly written and accessible for just about anyone. Unfortunately, the same cannot not be said about this movie, which is based upon two of the stories: The Daybreakers and Sackett. With great anticipation I watched this movie. I wanted to enjoy it, but no matter how hard I tried I coundn't for one simple reason: The acting is atrocious! Tom Selleck is awful. Mercedes McCambridge is awful (really awful), and sadly, worst of all is Glenn Ford. The best acting comes from the veterans Ben Johnson and Sam Elliot, barely. What frustrates me is that these are talented actors! What kind of direction were they receiving from Robert Totten?? ""One take and next scene"" must have been his credo. Really disappointing.Don't waste your money. Read the books instead.

"How to Handcolor like a Hallmark Artist.: This book is great if you want to stick to only one medium, Marshall Photo Oils. The examples are sappy and saccharine.Cutesy kids, flowers, bla bla bla! This book copies the style and explanations of Handcoloring Photographs Step by Step by Laird. Thats because Dorskind has nothing to say herself and doesn't know how to explain. Now you should buy the book by Laird. I, like most reviewers recommend it strongly. I also highly recommend to you Handtinting Photographs. Buy this book too. Don't buy Dorskind's book.

"Worst Dragonlance Book I Ever Read: I read my first Dragonlance more than 10 years ago and I've been an ardent fan since. So when I got my hands on this one, I was full of expectations.However, this book was a real letdown. I had to force myself to go through each page and finally gave up. The narration sounded like sentences in childrens' books. The kender didn't seem to act or speak like kender and the gully drarves were either too smart or too irritating. The death knight wasn't much of a Death Knight nor was Takhisis her usual Godlike self.The author, being new to Dragonlance series should have done her homework better and found out more about the Dragonlance world we all know and love. This was really a waste of such a promising title as a book of short stories on Uncle Trapspringer's adventures would indeed be very welcome to the Dragonlance series.

"The Endearing Honesty of A Woman's Life: My husband happened upon a copy of the original book in a thrift store and brought it home. It has now found a place of honor on my shelves. It takes you on Diana's journey through her self-discovery as a lesbian, through her brother's rejection of it, to the pain of heartbreak, to the lover that was a recurring interference, and to finally resting comfortably and contendly in the arms of the love that would be to stay. The book takes you through her childhood, her travels, and her education. She presents the story of a lesbian who is not out to emmasculate men, nor to promote women as the supreme goddess. She simply walked the road of her soul.

"Check out before you buy: The product looks ok. The buttons are nice and big and easy to read. They don't work very well though. For example when pushing on the speaker button to dial or answer the phone often I have to press it several times and just right for it to work. It does not come with the AC adapter and Northwestern Bell no longer makes or distributes them. Without the adapter the lights do not work, including the message waiting light. It is not what it was reported to be and does not function the way it is supposed to because it does not have an adapter. I have tried several stores such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, Walmart and Target to find an adapter (120VAC to 6V 100mA) and cannot find one. I have not been able to find one online either. Also the product information indicates this phone takes 3 AA batteries. It does not. This one takes 4 AAA batteries. Not that the size of the batteries makes any difference to me, but the description is not accurate for the item. I am sending it back.

For heaven's sakes never mind his errors regarding the women's lives, he puts Warm Springs (where FDR died) in West Virgina instead of Georgia(and where were his editors?) His lack of understanding of the truth of women's lives is no worse than many otherwise credible male biographers. Read it with a spoonful of salt, and you will learn of many women who have been overlooked. Just know going in that you are reading what amounts to a shallow overview magazine type article.

"The Best Wisdom Poetry Of Our Age: ""The dead can tell us, being dead, what no living personcan tell us,"" wrote T.S. Eliot. What Masters has done for us(when he was alive) is write a collection of whispered epitaphs,voices silently crying out from the graves the ironies, sadnesses, wastes, agonies, and miscalculations of their spent lives.This is not poetry to turn a phrase, necessarily. Nor is it poetry to enchant. Instead, it is Wisdom Poetry. Poetry that carries the weight of mistakes of the twisted lives, creating their own kind of hell (Hobbes: ""Hell is truth too late learned"").Written in 1915 and written as if for choral voices--wouldn't this be a great piece for a dramatic interpretation in which several voices perform each poem? Collected, it becomes overwhelming, just as a visit to a cemetary to mourn the losses of one of your loves can also be overwhelming.No, it is not sad, though. Somehow, hope still survives, like the shoot stabbing through the cracked granite toward the sun.

"Could've used more guitar, but still good: The latest offering from Unit: 187 is a little more geared towards total electronics than eletronics mixed with heavy guitars. But that doesn't make this a bad album. Most of the songs come off as instrumentals with Tod Law shouting one or two lines here and there. The electronics still have the trademark Unit: 187 sound...very abrasive and harsh. I would've maybe liked to have seen more lyrics or guitars in these songs, but they're still good. My favorite is by far the title track, which opens the record. Both mixes of Anger Management are also good. If you have the other releases from the boys, pick this one up as well. It's worth it in my opinion.

"LOVE this cookbook! Great old-fashioned recipes: Great cook book. A lot of great, tried and true recipes, like the standard Chocolate Chip Cookie and Peanut Butter Cookie. Love how they spell it 'Cooky' though. A few of the recipes are a bit outdated, like Prune cookies, but most of them have stood the test of time. Great fun to flip through, easy to read font, old-fashion little illustrations here and there and a lot of full colored pictures of the cookies. I have to say, some of the cookies aren't pretty, but they taste great. A true original and practical for children to use do to the ease of the ingredients and font style. Oh, and almost all of the recipes call for shortening, so substituting butter is a must. Great for collectors. Bought this to replace my Mom's original copy from the '60's.

Their debut is so much better, even though Jesse was what, 14 and sounding as Aaron Carter did when he was 11. I think it's highly unnecessary for a soundtrack, just because they are in the movie, to have 65% of the songs theirs. The only songs I really liked on this is ""I Say Yeah"" (which is, again, WAY better w/ the original version) and ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"", even though I dislike Play, I thought the song was pretty cute and Chris added a nice 'flair' to it.

Set around a funeral, a family gathered - perhaps for the very last time - in grief, and in the midst of a near-revolution, The May Fools manages to cover the entire history of the 60s through hope, euphoria, and paranoia, back to a cynical, sad reality.

"Struggles with Faith: There's no getting around it: regardless of his actual faith, Joseph Arthur is a Christian folk rocker. Nothing wrong with that, just a fact that grounds the sixteen stellar tracks of his third release Redemption's Son. Though his belief runs deep, the thrill in his work is that his faith doesn't come without continuous struggle. Like his idol (and label-owner) Peter Gabriel, Arthur turns experience of the day-to-day into the epic. Unlike Gabriel, his music is still in touch with the simple verities. He keeps his progressive tendencies in check, relying on solid narrative details and the ragged beauty of his countertenor. The title cut, ""Dear Lord"", ""Evidence"" - each root their moral struggle in a recognizable situation: absentee father, social estrangement, addiction. The drawback is that every song reaches the same conclusion - there's nothing that God can't put right. Still, it's a testament to Arthur's gifts that the end doesn't nullify the journey.

"Lauryn Hill is an exceptional music artist.: For anyone who is knowledgeable about music artists, you can only say one thing about Lauryn Hill. She is totally blessed with an extreme talent. Her music is so profound because so many can relate to her realness. It is clearly evident that when a host of people are moved with your music, you have touched a place universal in the hearts of those who have listened. When I first heard Lauryn in ""Sister Act"" and found out that she was a rapper in the group ""Fugees"", I said WHY? No disrespect towards rappers, I simply was floured when I heard her sing, I knew right then that I would be hearing more from her in the near future and it was manifested in her debut album. I am an artist myself and I would love to get the opportunity to work with her one day. ""She is what you call a music perfectionist"". And how beautiful to know where all the credit comes from, GOD. She is one who truly knows why she is so successful.

"A decent album, I've heard a lot better though...: Although I'll admit this CD has its charms, I firmly believe that it should not garner a five star rating.

"Very Good: I thought this video was very good. I haven't seen other versions, so I can't compare them, but I think it portrays the book excellently (although the book IS of course, better). The first tape is the best. Daniel Radcliffe does a wonderful job playing young David. The plot also follows the book and even the lines in the book very well. The character are cast perfectly. Mr. Murdstone is horrible, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber are exactly how they are in the book! In the second tape, I wish they hadn't cut out the part with the old Doctor, or Tommy Traddles. They focused more on his relationship with Dora and Agnes in the movie, whereas there are many themes going on at once in the book. Also some little things, like Agnes doesn't seem to take quite so kindly to Dora in the movie as she does in the book. But Maggie Smith is excellent as Betsy Trotwood (of course). Overall, this is a fabulous movie. Even if you haven't read the book, you'll want to after you see this.

"Ouch: This movie hurts me to watch it. Steven Segal gets shot up, put in a coma, and then he goes off killing people for revenge. The action is really cheesy, the plot is awful, and the one liners make you want to shoot Segal. Steven Segal can't act.Notice how his movies all seem to have three words ""Above the Law"" ""Hard to Kill"" ""Straight to Video""....oops.There is a quote in this movie after Steven Segal shoots at a guy's crotch. ""I missed. I never miss. They must be smaller than I thought."" This line was a mess up, the correct line is: ""I missed. I always miss. I must be lamer than I thought.""If you wish to suck seven years off of your life, then go ahead, otehrwise steer clear.

My one star is for the people at Mei Ah who put out this dvd. Whoever did the subtitle translation did not speak English well enough to graduate from a level one ESL class.

"A fine game once - but it will not run on modern Macs: This is a PowerPC game. Up through Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), Intel Macs had ""Rosetta,"" a technology for running PowerPC binaries on Intel machines.Apple discontinued Rosetta in Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), so there is not way to run this game (or any other PowerPC binaries) without emulating earlier versions of Mac OS X, or booting an earlier version on your Mac (which might not be possible with machines released after Lion).

"Oh Please!: Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not.

"ALL ARISE! THE HONORABLE JUDGE GRISHAM IS BACK!: After SKIPPING CHRISTMAS and, most recently, BLEACHERS I had begun to believe that John Grisham had been abducted by aliens. But with THE LAST JUROR Grisham comes home to what he knows best: legal literature.THE LAST JUROR tells the story of a young newspaperman who scrapes his funds together, along with help from family to buy The Clanton Times his old paper when he was starting out in the world of journalism. Playing his cards right and reporting on the ""dangerous"" story of a brutal crime and the trial that ensues, the paper is off and running.But, when perpetrator of the crime is released from prison early and members of the jury start turning up dead, the people of small town Clanton are faced with the vengeance of the criminal and his family.Okay, the resolution of the story is predictable but THE LAST JUROR but the writing is vintage Grisham and marks his almost prodigal return to legal drama and that's certainly worth the wait.THE HORSEMAN

"The Last Juror: I am a huge fan of John Grisham, have read all of his books, but I have to admit, I have been disappointed with his last few books and The Last Juror takes the cake in that department. It has a great plot, but Mr. Grisham goes no where with it. It starts off very strong, but half way through and all the way to the end, it is awful. I found myself skimming through the pages asking myself ""what in the world does this have to do with the story?"". Any Grisham fan out there should read it just to read it, but do not expect anything that Grisham's potential has to offer.

"Very disappointing: Being a huge Grisham fan, I could not wait to read The Last Juror. That quickly turned to being unable to wait to finish it! The book began great, but quickly changed.

"boring: I took this book on vacation expecting a great read and it turned out to be a boring tedious read. If not for the Grisham name this book would not be on any best seller list.

"WORST BOOK TO ME; OTHERS FIND IT BEST.: This is the worst book I've ever read because it was advertised as a THRILLER but there was zero suspense. It was such a boring book that it's a wonder that I even finished it. In contrast, I read the DA Vinci Code in 3 days because I simply couldn't put the book down.If the Last Juror had been advertised as a novel about a small Southern town, somewhat like To Kill A Mockingbird, I would have had a different mindset and probably would have enjoyed it more. I read Mockingbird in 3 days also.

"If You Want to Read About Small Town Living: At first, The Last Juror held my interest like most of Grisham's books do. After the murder trial, which takes place very quickly, the book begins to sag. It becomes a diary of small-town living as seen through the eyes of city slicker Willie Traynor and doesn't pick up much again. What a disappointment.

"Grisham's not so stunning ""comeback"": This having been his first legal thriller in a couple years, I was not completely impressed by the movement or character development in this book. I have read all of Grisham's books and would easily place this near the bottom of the list.The initial concept is interesting, but his storytelling was lackluster and characters a bit cliched.I kept thinking the ""crime family"" resembled the Clampetts and his protaganist was unbelievable at times. A lot of the characters were shallow, and the end was disappointing.If you are going to read this, wait for the paperback or get it from the library.Or just re-read the good ones: A Time to Kill, The Client, The Brethren and The Pelican Brief.
",1,1
"Fast reading, barely worth it: Several good court scenes are not enough to salvage this book, as Grisham stretches the plot needlessly through page after page. Actually, although this book is fast-enough reading, you can get through it even faster by checking out the plot summary on the dust jacket. It takes you up to page 291 (out of about 370). Even then, the ending is rather anticlimactic.Hard-core Grisham fans, wanting to preserve their record of reading everything he's written, will have a reason to read this book. The rest of us can surely find better ways to spend even the short time needed to read it.

"fast to slow page turner: I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for.

"A Character Study: The Last Juror seems to show Grisham's change as an author. In his early works he wrote suspense stories. In The Last Juror the suspense which is secondary to the development of wonderful characters. Miss Callie is a wonderful woman who shows how a powerful force for good can make her whole family better. It is worth reading this book just to meet her.The rest of the small town characters such as Harry Rex and Baggy as well as Will himself and his grandmother are wonderfully drawn.Some reviewers have commented that the book lacked suspense. It seems that Grisham is moving in his work. Rather than a fast moving book such as Angels and Demons with little character development, Grisham is now writing slower moving books with wonderful characters. The Testament and the King of Torts are examples. I think that the new Grisham is every bit as enjoyable as the early Grisham but just a little different.

"A fun, fast read...: Not familiar with Grisham's work other than the fact that he seems suspiciously prolific, I wasn't expecting anything particularly special. Therefore, I was very plesantly surprised by how well written, compelling and seemingly personal this very entertaining story turned out to be.Great for that long plane ride or to take along on vacation, this smartly written story which says quite a bit about the author's sensitive impressions of the world around him, will keep you interested every chapter of the way.

"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (What a snoozer): I read this book a while ago, but recently thought about it again when someone brought up bad books.I had never read a Grisham novel before this one, and I really expected so much more with all the hype his novels get. As it stands, I have not picked up a Grisham novel since reading this one. What a terrible book. Maybe I missed something, but there didn't seem to be any noteworthy plotlines to warrant writing a book about. I kept thinking, ""When is all the action gonna happen? When is all the intrigue and suspense going to take place?"" Well, here's the answer: NEVER.I made it all the way to the end of the book, only because I didn't want to think I'd wasted my time reading the earlier chapters. I was going to make it through the book even if it killed me -- but at least that would have been more action than was in the book!

"Definitely not his best work: I found the storyline of this book to be very interesting, but it kept deviating away from the story and introduced way too many characters, that in my opinion, had little or nothing to do with the story. It's almost as if this was a short story stretched into novel length. Either that or the author was under a deadline to crank the next book out and this is the result. Still overall it wasn't terrible, but still not one of his best works, that's for certain.

"This is the worst book he has ever written: This is the by far the worst book I have ever purchased. I would love to have my money back. What was John Grisham thinking about, when he wrote this? Obviously, he wasn't thinking. I have read everyone of his books, and if the rest of them are going to be like this, I will have to pass. I am an avid reader of John's; I am the one that can't wait until his next book comes out. I will have to wait next time, because I won't ever read another one like this!!!!!!!!!!!!

"It tries and tries...: Get a big cauldron. Next, drop in Blade Runner, Laura Croft and Krull. Mix haphazardly. Throw in pointless and gratuitous nude scenes, a pair of boots with six-inch heels and a weak plot. Simmer in a dank, dark place for two hours and you have the equivalent of 'Gene Generation'.While the idea behind the movie shows some minor promise, the constant sub-plots and generic fight scenes throw the whole film off center. Even the obvious physical talents of Bai Ling don't save this film, despite her best efforts. The special effects supporting the film's pseudo-science are ghastly (not in a good way); It looks like a ball of worms threw up on the actors.This is a B-movie, and a poor example to-boot. If not for the driving music score and the sheer beauty of Bai Ling, it wouldn't even rate that high.

"Classic mystery, no major flaws: I think the serial killer plot has been done to death, but back when the Prime Suspect series started, it didn't seem tired.It was very enjoyable to see this program again, so long after it was on television. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. I think the editing could be tighter. But the plot and the acting can't be faulted.As all the men on the detective squad are so ""shocked"" at a woman being put in charge of an investigation -- this aspect of the movie seems very dated now.Contrary to another reviewer, I found the DVD quality very good. This was made for TV and one cannot expect the same vivid image of a theatrical feature. Two dual-layer discs for a 210 minute program certainly provides sufficient data rate.Personally, I don't think this has good replay value, unless you intend to wait another ten years to watch it again. As such, the product seems overpriced to me. This is probably a better candidate for a rental.

"Ukrainian Tenor in later life: Many of these are from recordings made when this fabulous Ukrainian tenor was old. The Russians worked him well into his 90s. But what a voice. Even though these are from his later life, they are better than nothing. This voice is definitely one of a kind, with emotion so involving that it often draws tears to listeners' eyes. People who have only heard this recording of his voice should get earlier examples. As a younger man Kozlovsky sang with the most incredibly bel canto line squeezing every bit of meaning from the words. When I recently asked a very famous modern Russian baritone what he thought of Kozlovsky's voice, he said he did not like it. As a trained singer, I pressed him to explain further and he just muttered, ""He sings in the old way."" Whatever the old way is, I want it. It has passion and subtle nuances of feeling, quite different from some present-day singers' tendency to ""bellow"" while trying to demonstrate drama.

"Loved it!: Reading through the table of contents of the book I had this sense of familiarity. The first few chapters have been titled and themed in such a way that it bring to mind the creation story found in the Bible. Granted, that's not what this book is about and I don't believe the story of creation found in the pages of Genesis is meant to be taken as literal scientific fact, however, I appreciate the sense of wonder and significance the framing gives to the beginning of time (even though, taken as is, it's not as if the beginning of our universe was lacking in wonder). Still, by borrowing a bit from the structure of the Genesis story, I think Ackroyd gives a bit of familiarity to the history and science he's sharing. Ackroyd weaves together science, a storytellers skill, easy page layout, and fascinating pictures and illustrations for a good overview of the very beginning of our planet to the final emergence of Homo sapiens.

"One of the Top Ten Worst Movies of All Time: I am still in shell-shock that people of quality such as Chloe Sevigny & Stephen Rea could even finish filming this piece of dog doo-doo, this thing is beyond horrid - there aren't enough words to convey how much this thing stunk! The movie starts out ok, steadily begins to make less & less sense, becomes just utterly non-sensical, and THEN takes a very sharp turn into pure absurd idiocy - and WAY over-the-top gore. NONE of it making any sense, mind you. NONE OF IT. Not the time structure of events, not the things taking place, and most assuredly not the moronic ending. I was quite angry that I'd spent $1.08 at my discount video to even rent it.

"Short stories for philosophers, literature snobs, and lovers of the unusual: Albert Camus, born in Algeria in 1913, won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957 and died three years later, but his writings live on. This collection of six unusual, strange-endinged stories will probably be of interest to a wide range of short story fans. Sometimes seemingly vague and symbolic (and with odd titles and endings), they are thoroughly enjoyable and readable. Though similar in complexity, subject matter and settings vary greatly: a woman joins her fabric-selling husband on a business trip, a detongued former missionary awaits his replacement, barrel makers strike, a prisoner is foisted on a schoolmaster, an artist works amidst ever-changing chaos, and an engineer visits inhabitants near the site of a future dam. Exile and the Kingdom is an excellent, strange, brief book. Other strange short stories: Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman by Haruki Murakami.

It is all the same for Paul Williams who takes it ALL in and lovingly dissects every speck of Dylan's output. Paul Williams was a lone voice in the wilderness back in the ""Dylan: What Happened"" days so this serves as an extension of that important book.

"Best TV Series EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER: As the cover said, this is the TV series that still stands as the benchmark for others. Knock-out performances by the incomparable Laurence Olivier, Jeremy Irons and last but not least in my opnion the best character ever put down on film: Sebastian by Anthony Andrews.Well, all will know this story about romantic yearning, friendship, loss and mostly the English charm of it.In a concluding scene with Charles Ryder he was told by an old studentfriend that that charm (of Sebastian) was dangerous, and that it almost took the best of him.And that might be true in a general sense: once seen it is hard to come to terms with it, first that this series is finite, and second the tragic fate of indeed the most charming person on screen yet, Sebastian, that sort of friend that we are all looking for, but who is so hard to find!

"Great Art based on Great Art: This production need not be limited to ""ever made for TV."" This is one of the greatest and most profound movies ever made. Every element of every scene is superb and riveting. I watched it again, twenty years after first seeing it, and enjoyed it even more with my Southern Baptist wife who kept insisting ""let's watch just one more episode""!This story is esentially Catholicism talking to itself through both the main characters and the sheer majesty of the Brideshead Estate (Castle Howard). This work is epically and evengelically Catholic. Anyone who sees ""Brideshead Revisited"" will find his tongue stopped about pedophile priests and ""Hitler's pope"" because his mind has been slowly, platonically wrestled around to see the glory of God's church on earth. Waugh is a midwife first, author second; and I would say the same of Mortimer, who made this production happen. Thank God for both men and for this production.

"Blu-Ray version washed out and colorless: This is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, but I have never been so disappointed in any product as I was with this one. Don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version. It has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat, colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail. (I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs-Downstairs, also by Acorn Media.) I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead.

"Schiller: This is the second edition of this book. The Translator spent years on researching and putting Schiller's works together. He worked closely with the Germans to make sure that he got this right. However, the second edition has the Translator's very own poem; The Translators Apology To The Reader as he had to make some corrections in his own translating. Schiller was a controversy of sorts in his time. Many of his poetry has to do with his one love Laura, the lady who first captured his heart, and had great impact on his life.

"What a disappointment...: I agree wholeheartedly with the first reviewer- what is the point of this boxed set? I have YesYears as well, and almost every other Yes cd. This boxed set adds very little that is new, and might only be worth buying for someone without any Yes cd's, or who is new to listening to the band. Other boxed sets (Jethro Tull, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, etc.) were done very well by their respective record companies, and make a lot of sense.The one good thing about this box set is that (supposedly) all the music was remastered. If Rhino goes back and re-releases some of Yes's albums with bonus tracks (as they are doing for the band Chicago), I would definitely be interested in buying that.

Disdaining the live tracks, solo meanderings (The Fish?), and subpar B-sides that afflicted Yesyears, this 6-hour package sounds and looks great. Nothing (incl.

"Fantastic but: The design of this basketball system is fantastic. It is so easy to move and so easy to raise or lower the backboard. It is sturdier than most movable systems and with the 4 wheels and the leaver action you can easily move it from one place to the other without emptying the reservoir. If it is a windy day you can easily lower the back board. Now that I have raved about the product let me give you the negative, if you are not mechanically inclined, do not even attempt to put this together. The directions are terrible and there are a lot of moving parts. After putting it together there are a lot of left over nuts and bolts and you wonder what you have forgotten, but the directions are very bad so you had to guess at what they meant. So I recommend that you hire someone to put this together which is what we had to do to get this put up. Took the person many hours to get it together and he was not working by an hourly rate.

"Trite and predictable: I was excited to read this book based on the reviews, my love of history. I was extremely disappointed. The characters here are one dimensional, uttering predictable catch-phrases, and are basically uninteresting. I got through about 200 pages and couldn't even finish. The main character is increadibly driven, and consequently his reactions throughout the story become entirely predictable. He has no depth and the author doesn't create any kind of sympathy, empathy, or interest between the character and the reader. I really didn't care what happened to him or any of the characters in the book. I think I'll stick with Bernard Cornwell, or Sharon Kay Penman.

"A big disappointment: I disagree with the reviewer who characterized the author as a poor writer. She isn't. The problem is the content. After reading the first 90 pages, I put the book down, finally admitting to myself that I really didn't care what Ms. Powell thought or opined about anything. I was finding her blog-turned-book to be just one more rant from a neurotic New Yorker, a genre for which my tolerance peaked several years ago. It was never that high to begin with.Unfortunately, a friend had given me the book, thinking I'd enjoy it because of my fondness for Julia Child. Maybe that contributed to my reaction to the author. Juxtaposing herself with Julia Child invites one to think about issues of character, style and substance. On all those measures, Ms. Powell suffers.My recommendation: see the movie, but forget the book.

"Catastrophic Hissy Fit: How do you take an idea with so much promise and turn it into an excruciating read? You allow someone like Julie Powell to write about it, that's how. Never in my entire life have I found the narrator of a book more irritating than I did Powell. More a filthy-mouthed diatribe of her whiney ways than the entertaining cookalogue it should have been, had Julia Child lived to read ""Julie & Julia,"" undoubtedly she would have deemed it just as disrespectful and non-serious as she did Julie and her ""project."" I wanted to like this book; I really did. In the end, however, it's nothing more than something Powell claims to have regularly on subway platforms: a catastrophic hissy fit. One can only hope the movie fares better, but then again, it could hardly do worse. Two stars for managing to steer unlikeability and awful writing to the top of the bestseller chart. Kudos for that amazing feat at least.

"A Rambling Mess: I picked this book up with an expectation of a fun memoir read. The premise was unique...cooking all 524 recipes from Julia Child's Art of French Cooking.

Very, very disappointing.

"Stay as a Blogger: This is a terrible book. Julie Powell is, on her own admission, not a good cook and the text proves it. And on the evidence of this book she is not a good writer either. I am accustomed to swearing (it is generally a substitute for vocabulary), but the use of foul language throughout is distasteful. Perhaps her moment of fame will inspire her. I doubt it. She should stick to blogging. Poor Julia - passe she may be, but she must be turning in her grave at this travesty.

"too much julie not enough julia: The politics gets really old really fast as do the day to day lives of the self absorbed and rather dull cast of characters.

"Don't Buy This Just Because You Liked the Blog: I read the Julie/Julia Project blog occasionally and enjoyed it. I thought that the book would be similar, but it wasn't. I don't object to irreverent opinions and random stories in a foodie memoir, but she took out too much of what made the blog fun and what she replaced it with lacks wit and charm. Powell's writing feels forced and her contrived expositions of how hip, liberal, and shocking she is/wants to be pall quickly.

"I did not like this book: After reading some of the reviews I see that there seem to be two sets of camps regarding this book: folks either loved it or hated it. I guess I'll have hang out with the haters. Julie Powell comes off as an extremely unpleasant, immature little princess. It's a good idea: a year cooking from Julia Child's French cooking book but it's just so hard to read. The whole thing is snark and whine and it tiresome after a few chapters.

"Don't waste your time or money on this awful book!: Very poorly written book. It's all over the place. The ""f"" word seemed to be thrown in simply to fill space. At times I didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about. She tried to be funny - and failed miserably. And besides being boring and poorly written she frequently takes cheap shots at republicans, which were just distracting and irritating.Simply put this book is nothing like I was expecting and I am so glad that I got a copy from the library and didn't contribute one dime to this woman's bank account. I returned it to the library the very next day - unfinished.Very disppointing, this was such a good idea for a book and a movie, but Julie Powell just wasn't up to the task...at least not to my standards.

"I tried: I wanted to like this book. I've curled up with it a couple times now, thinking that I was just being difficult and should give it another chance. I absolutely love Laurie Colwin's writing, surely I should enjoy this. But I just didn't. I can't explain why sometimes cranky writing is warm and endearing and sometimes it isn't, but something is lacking in this book. And while it's true that she tracks down such things as bone marrow and squab for authenticity's sake, she misses another recipe's texture completely because she doesn't have a cooking thermometer. Surely every grocery store with even a handful of implements for sale offers a cooking thermometer (probably for less than the cost of a squab)?

"Narcissistic Hipsters Should Cook, Not Write: After seeing the movie, I knew what I was in for when I read the book. Julia Child is a survivor, a truly original pioneer of the old school, disciplined and humble. She is everything that hipster bloggers, like the author, is not - whiny, narcissistic, entitled, yet full of illusions of her own grandeur and hero-worshipping of everything ""vintage"" and iconic - in this case it's Julia Child. I wasn't surprised Child responded the way she did - who would want to be used as a marketing gimmick and turned into a cultural totem object by a wimpy, girl-woman who has the life experience of an ameoba? Julia Child must have sensed this and stayed away.

"disappointing: I love both cooking and reading blogs, so I thought this book would be a natural fit for me. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy much about it. The writing is so-so, and the author's ""deep thoughts"" that come from her cooking experiences are pretty banal and predictable.I did get a laugh that there are book club questions included at the end - I can't imagine that any book club would select this book - there is just not a lot of substance here. I'd give this one a miss.
",1,1
"Just OK: The character was self-absorbed past distraction. In fact, she was so distracted that most of the time she could not get out of her own way. And where was she going? And why do I want to read about it? I also found it difficult relating Julia Child's ""diary"" excerpts to the life-experiences of Julie that they were spliced into. If it wasn't a book club book, I wouldn't have finished it.
",1,1
"Horrible Recipes Made Bearable: As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by much.Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this.

We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds! Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this. I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED! Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket. I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier!

Would recommend Miracle Blanket; costs more but is one-size fits all and is adjustable as they grow. Just don't put it in the dryer...

"Ok, but there are better swaddlers: I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore. Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other ""miracle"" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the ""miracle"" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money.

The action scenes you see in the commercials are the only scenes with anything interesting shown in them, and most of the movie is just Peter Parker sitting in his aunt's house drinking tea, and/or hanging out with Mary Jane, who has a more boring character than she did in the first one. This movie has the audacity to call itself an action movie, but it is more of a teen angst drama, with one or two scenes of action. In fact, I do not see why this movie got a PG-13 rating for violence. It's closer to a G. This movie is a BIG letdown after the first one, and it will not be on anyone's future list of favorites (or at least, I hope not).

"I wanted to like it I really did!: I thought it was slow and predictable. Tobey was good as Spiderman but his character seemed a bit whiny and was too much of an idiot. I don't get it why everyone likes Spiderman so much it's not that good of a movie. I didn't like the first one much either both Spiderman movies suck and I hope the 3rd one will be better but it will probably be the same as the first two. It's in my opinion if I didn't like it don't get mad why I didn't like it I just didn't like it.

"Spiderman 2: Grade A+: This film is quite possibly the best film sequel ever made. It outshines the 2001 original. The action, special effects, acting, story, and the villain are all improved. The action is this film is heart pumping, non stop, and fun to watch. The special effects have greatly improved over the past three years, especially in the aerial shots of New York City. The acting in the film is better especially in Mary Jane's character. The story is definately improved, due to the emphasis on Harry Osborne's hate of Spiderman, and Peter Parker having to juggle his life around being a superhero. Another great aspect of this film is the new villain, Doc. Oc. This villain you can hate and sympathize with unlike the totally sinister green goblin. The film's ending sets up perfectly for a third installment to this wonderful film series that will last for generations.

"Marketing really does work.: I can understand just wanting to watch a trashy action film but this movie was just annoying. Tobey Maguire did his best to convince us that he really is a wet noodle. His snivelling self-conflicted, let-me-show-you-my-feminine-side routine was a bit overplayed. For a minute I thought that it was the exact character that he played in Cider House. Somehow I couldn't help imagining Roger Ebert with a toothy grin, ramming popcorn in his mush while fawning over Maguire's touching portrayal of a superhero in conflict. Seriously, this was a casting disaster that the marketing department saved. A few reviews ago somebody mentioned ""not seeing enough of maquire's body."" Was that a joke? After seeing him in this film I am ready to concede that there is a place for steroid use in this world. Reading these reviews I'm suspecting that the production company is paying people to write reviews on amazon.

"smallville anyone?: I must admit the sequel is bucketloads better than the first. That said, the rest sucks. Spiderman is a total copy cat of Superman and Smallville. The villians and the characters are total ripoffs. Money wasted. Do yourself a favor and watch a better movie. Make it Superman.

"Don't listen to the other reviewers it sucked!: I did not like Spiderman 2 at all (...)! It was like watching a soap opera movie or something with no action in it. All there is, is just graphics there's not any fighting in it. Doc Ock wasn't a villian at all he was just tryin to go after Spiderman for what he did to him and all. I don't really see Tobey Maguire as Spiderman that much he just wasn't right at all. Kirsten Dunst was allright as MJ and she's georgeous. I wouldn't mind having a girl like that. James Franco would have been a better Spiderman than Tobey Maguire. Why did they had to choose Tobey? I hate Tobey Maguire and all of his movies they suck and he's also boring who never says a word. But anyways don't waste your money on this movie it's very bad. That goes along with the first Spiderman. Both Spiderman movies suck!

"Awful - Nearly Painful: I liked the first movie. It was generally Hollywood fluff, but was interesting enough that I could suspend my disbelief to the point I found it enjoying. An acquaintance of mine recently raved about the sequel and between that and the reviews here I was very anxious to see it when my colleague mentioned she had just bought it. Imagine my surprise when I caught myself watching the clock, rolling my eyes and eventually contemplating shutting off the machine during several points in the film.Kirsten Dunst lost whatever acting ability she had shortly after Interview with a Vampire. She doesn't seem to have the range or depth to portray the complexities of the relationship between M.J. and Parker. Macguire, I guess, plays a sadsack to a tee - but I don't think I've ever seen him play anything else.The one redeeming part of the entire movie is the fight scenes, while completely unbelievable - the effects are flawless.

"good, but the first was better: Spiderman was good, but I liked the first spiderman movie a lot more. This one was too much of Peter Parker not having his powers, and doing stupid stuff. For example, why did he keep on taking off his mask. The time on the train was understandable because spiderman could not see, but the rest of the times were just stupid choices for people to know spidermans identity. Also, why did spiderman keep on losing his powers. Shouldn't he still have his powers even if he didn't want to be spiderman. When Peter parker got bit by the spider in the first place, he didn't want powers, but he had them anyway. Now why is he losing them?The first one was better, but see this one anyway.

"Wilbur Smith at his best: I bought my first Wilbur Smith book Nov'86. It was translated to Swedish. At that time (being 22 years old) I hadn't yet started to read in english on a regular basis. Out of curiosity I counted the books from this author that I had bought over the years, and I found to my surprise that I had 19 different novels. I like all of them. If you purchase 'Birds of Prey' it is a good introduction to also buy other novels from the same author. Just a warning; dont pick it up and start to read unless you know that you have some time to spare. This book will not let you do other things for a while. All of his books are entertaining, highly interesting and yet educational at the same time. The perfect companion to bring when you want to have a quiet moment on your own and relax with a good book.

"A trashy, macho bodice-ripper for guys.: When I started reading Birds of Prey, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and setting. Then I started groaning at the incredibly predictable behavior of the cardboard cutout characters. By 1/4 of the way through, I found myself hypnotized by the parade of every stereotypical character I remember from the trashy adventure books I loved when I was 12. The young, perfect hero. His loyal negro sidekick. The noble, tragic father. The backstabbing piratical villain. The fat, ugly, cowardly, corrupt, rich villain. The cruel villain who is, however, a ""true warrior"". The sultry temptress. The beautiful imprisoned princess. A half-dozen more plot elements which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling the book. In every way, at best an average book.

"Fundamentals of Management: Fundamentals of Management is a great book to get started in management. It covers everything that you would need to know. I like this book in particular because it has chapter tests at the end of every chapter so that you can kind of test yourself over what you had just did. I also liked how the definitions are out to the side of the reading as well as in bold in the reading. It makes it easy to find the words that you are looking for. I have learned a lot from this book. I went with some experience in managing and still learned something new every time I turned the page.

"Follett's Guide to Usage: As one who thinks it necessary to own every major English usage manual from Fowler on, I here state the firm opinion that Follett is the best of the reasonably contemporary examples and second only to Fowler. Follett is more erudite, more complete (not more comprehensive, I grant), and more analytical than the rest. (Yes, Bryan, this means you). For example, compare his treatment of the indefensible ""in terms of"" to any other.Someone speaks here of ""disagreeing"" with Follett's remarks on prescriptivism. Well, if you're not a prescriptivist then you oughtn't be reading usage manuals, and if you are one yet still disagree, you'd better find arguments more persuasive than his.Another critic says Follett isn't terribly useful as a quickhow-to guide. Well, true, but the genuine articles never are.

"Should become a comedy classic: This is Cyrano de Bergerac updated and told with the craziness of Steve Martin's brain--a wonderful, funny movie. Martin is the fire chief of a scenic Northwest resort town. There are two newcomers to town: a professional firefighter (Rick Rossovich) and a beautiful female astronomer (Daryl Hannah). Martin, the self-assured, passionate but ugly (that schnoz) chief and Rossovich, the dumb but handsome hunk both fall for Hannah; of course Hannah is interested in the hunk. But Rossovich is unable to talk to bright women, so Martin feeds him lines and Hannah is swept off her feet. The mistaken identity is all worked out satisfactorily by picture's end (Martin wins Hannah). Everything works perfectly in this movie, and Martin is at his very best. I've watched this quite a few times over the years and the humor never gets stale. A terrific movie.

(Okay, a lot of a letdown.) It's...well...boring. It lacks the intricate construction, memorable melodies and harmonies that earlier albums and tracks have. Take ""To Go Beyond II"": It has almost a fairytale, magical sound to it; ""China Roses"": It has beautiful harmonies and ""softness"" in it that delight the ears; ""Long Boats"" has a feeling of power and strength in it.Sadly, ""Amarantine"" has none of that.We all know Enya can do much better.

'Amarantine' and 'Somebody Said Good-bye' remind me of the vocal songs from 'A Day Without Rain'. I never much cared for the songs with words before Wild Child, Lazy Days, etc, which are among my favorites from all of her works. 'Less than a Pearl' is hauntingly beautiful, and 'Semiregusa' is also very pretty.I've always enjoyed listening to any of Enya's albums to relax from a long day at work, for yoga and meditation; this album will definitely go into that mix. The above-mentioned songs will also go on my own 'Best of..' CD.

"A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music.

How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for ""It's in the Rain"" for me.

I felt that ""It's In the Rain"" was a little stilted. ...but only a little.I'll put all of Enya's CD's on shuffle play [that's 4 hours of music] and sit down, happy as a clam, with a good book.

"It's good, not great. About right for the price.: This sharpener is good, not great, but probably right for the price. I sharpened a bunch of pencils in a row (we homeschool) and it ran smoothly about 90% of the time. There were a few clunky starts, nothing dramatic but not perfect. Also, and this is the reason for the lack of stars; the drawer is a bit of a pain. When you sharpen, of course there are shavings in the small drawer which is accessible right on the front, below the hole. Well, when you go to put the drawer back in, it's a tiny bit of a struggle. There is a small plastic `tube' or offshoot in the back of the drawer and you have to line it up with a hole inside the machine.

Thankfully I was wrong.""I, Robot"" contained an even balance of not only action, but psychology, sociolgy, philosophy, the clash of logic and emotions, life, and unconditional love. The movie made you think and feel with its knowledge, although its visuals and sounds were equally appealing with another nice balance of the present and the movie's version of the future. Such a natural feeling is rare in action films which helped the mind to agree that it is believable.If you watch this movie watch it not only for its action, but its beautiful philosophies.

The second one did the exact same thing.Save your time and money and order a normal DVD.

"Not Even The Same Story As The Book!!!: The story is totally different than the book. All they took was the name and a couple of the characters.The story was pretty much a rip-off of the Terminator. Just think about it.(...) What is this thing next to the what, who did this and why?

"Ugh! What a travesty that this book was published!: Drag, drag, drag. I kept reading for two reasons: the first, I had nothing better to do one Sunday, and the second, I kept hoping something significant would happen. It didn't. This story had no climax, no capture, no passion. Who wants to read about the somber day to day lives of boring spinsters? (Of course I did, what a waste). Alice Hoffman is off my reading list. Her use of profanity was unwarranted and did not emphasize meaning in anything. Her characters were flat and the overall flow was slow if not stagnant. The ending was short and curt, as if she was just as bored writing it as it was to read. Unremarkable!

"Maybe 3 and 1/2 Stars: I picked this book up expecting to get lost in a magical world (maybe something like Harry Potter!) but this book failed to deliver on that front. The magic was underhanded and unorganized. However, with that said, this was still a good read. Examining the dynamics between two generations of sisters was interesting, and the writing moved along comfortably. Overall, it's worth reading, but don't expect to be mesmerized!

"For Those Who Like Intellectual Jibberish: If you liked high school poetry class, you might like this movie. Both my wife and I hated it because the teachers always seemed to find some meaning in a poem that completely mystified us. I thought this movie was going to be a search for the missing sixteen-year-old sister of the main character. If she found out what happened, it must have been hidden just like those esoteric 'meanings' our teachers found in the poems they assigned. I thought the movie was still setting the background when it suddenly ended. What it was all about, I have no idea.This is a movie for those who like to spout intellectual jibberish and think it means something. Or, maybe you have to be on some kind of illegal drug to make any sense of this movie?

I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie. It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!).

"what's up w/ Jarrett: This is a great album of atmospheric, moody music. Gary's bass sounds great and he plays well throughout. Jack accents the mood and only really opens up on the last two tracks. I would consider this one of my all time favorites if not for one thing: Keith Jarrett moaning and whining. I can't understand it. His playing is so beautiful and lyrical, all overlaped w/ these strange and annoying noises. I know it is an expression of emotion while playing, but I find it highly destracting. This album, though, is good enough to look past it. Barely.

In approaching such a bold and innovative work, I find much of what I love in movies. That experience is beautiful. Persona is one of the few films which can do that for me as well as it does.

"Nope, not worth it: Rated at 1000mAh, just like the original Panasonic battery for my TZ5. Only had 1/2 the life at first. A little over a year later, it only lasted for 4-8 picture and 3-5 minutes' worth of video. After a year and a half, this battery is dead. Not even recommended as a backup. Spend the extra few dollars and get one with a better user rating, more mAh, or better yet, just get the Panasonic.*Update: I returned it under their 3 year warranty (though they now say it's only 2). I had to pay $2 to ship it back to them (which is fine), and now they say I owe them another $7.50 for shipping and handling. Wow, this battery only costs $7.14 new right now.**Update #2: I ignored their request for another $7.50, but after a month or so, they sent me a new one anyway (which has been sitting in my desk ever since, since I bought a higher quality backup battery in the meantime...the Kinamax 1300mAh S007 for about 15 bucks).

This book shows one side, from an emotional person who was hurt and angry. If you read this book, you do yourself and history a disservice if you do not read Jay Cristol's book as well. I was ""horrified"" by the incident, as any American would be, until I read the explanations and facts addressed by Judge Cristol.

Unless you went into the the router wirelessly and resetted it manaully. The latest firmware upgrade they have for the router is a beta v1.2 - And if you have a a problem with beta versions of their firmware you cannot call them (Netgear).... you have to email .... beta@netgear.com or something like that.

So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes!

"Waste of Time.: Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number.

"Great look at the feastival!: I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless.

"Box Of Hair: I heard that Cub broke up. If it's true it's truly tragic. Cub are a female trio from the Great White North who specialize in sugary-sweet pop gems with a very little bit of a country feel. Sometimes they remind me of The Fastbacks. They play clean with little or no distortion & make good use of light-hearted humor. The Last 2 tracks ""Riverside"" & ""Not What You Think (Live)"" show that they can do much more than the seemingly empty cutsie pop songs. Their pop songs, however, are not as vacuous as they may appear to be on the surface. They are smart, creative & heart warming. I don't know if this is Cub's best album, because they are all so good, but I do know that if bands like Heavenly, Go Sailor & Butterglory make you happy, then so will Cub.

"Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware: This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support, really. Waited on hold for 45 min. After talking with them. I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops. So now instead of using my new 120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive. I have another 120GB external drive. But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money.

"Alan Moore's writing for comics: I wanted more of a ""how to book"" on comic writing, concerning breaking in, making contacts, etc. Too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk. It's a small enough book to skim through and I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer? But for those of us who have yet to make it. Nah.

"How to create comics from the man who changed them.: Alan Moore's work is among the most influential in the comics field. This essay, which is bound in a comic-style format, is short but gets the creative juices going. He shares some useful insight into storycraft and framing plots for the comics medium. I do not write comics (prose fiction is my area), but I dound this insightful and inspiring. If you like his work in Watchmen and Swamp Thing, this is definitely worth picking up. And it is very, very cheap.

"Great, so where is it now?: If you like Seal and his passionate, powerful voice then this abreviated release is a must have. Stripped of all the production effects these raw versions of some of Seal's best songs show Seal for the artist he is and they really highlight the emotional power of his voice. The huge problem is you can't find this release anywhere anymore. That's a true disservice to Seal and his fans.

"Olivia, the vocalist: While promoting this album in 1989, Olivia appeared on a TV show with Dionne Warwick. During the show, Dionne said how Olivia's voice could be defined : clear as crystal. And that's exactly what this CD showcases : Olivia Newton-John's crystal clear voice.Hitting wonderful high notes in such a soft way, Olivia delivers standards such as ""Over the rainbow"" or ""Reach out for me"" with that special quality that makes her so unique. My favorite tracks on this are, by far, ""You'll never walk alone"" and ""When you wish upon a star"" - these always give me goosebumps...Originally intended for her then 3 year old daughter, this CD is a perfect gift for moms-to-be, or just simply a wonderful gift, either for yourself or for someone else...

"The day the world came to town: Having recently watched a ""Made for TV"" movie based on the true events contained in this book I was anxious to read the facts about the way the good folk of Gander, Newfoundland rallied round & accomodated, fed & entertained an influx of 6,600 air travellers aboard 39 planes which had been diverted to their town due to American airspace being shut down on 9/11.I was not disappointed !Jim Defede, the writer, presents a very well written account of the 4 days that the world came to Gander & chronicals both the huge logistical operation and the emotional experiences for both passengers and townsfolk.Many friendships were formed over those 4 days which exist to the present day, and I cannott commend the town of Gander enough for the humble, caring way they held out the hand of genuine friendship to complete strangers.This is a "" must read"" book.

"A different look at 9/11: I really enjoyed this book. It gives you a different perspective on Sept. 11th. We have read so many stories of the people who perished on that day and this story talks about those people who were totally inconvenienced by the events. It is so interesting to hear their stories and how this little town welcomed these people from all over the world. Many of the stories are very heartwarming and also sad. Once you get started it is a hard book to put down. Highly recommended for anyone who has more interest in reading about 9/11.

"They work!: I have tried every ice pack on the market! The ace ones are great, but every single one leak! No matter how careful I am with them.....they leak at the seams. These are less expensive and with proper care last forever! When using them cold, you do need a cover of some sort........an old pillow case works well folded over several times. Plus the size works well. Big enough to sit on your head for those migraines without falling off easily. Sometimes holding your head still to keep the ice pack on ends up hurting your neck, which makes your head worse. Defeats the purpose. For the money, this one is a good choice!

"fair towards midland: This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's ""Prose Edda"", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture.

"And most important, my wife likes it....: I was not sure if I wanted a rocker or a fixed recliner for my outdoor porch. I came across this glider by accident and at first dismissed it. I remember as a kid seeing gliders made of metal with springs that groaned and made up of fused together rust. After reading other reviews and taking a chance, I bought it. It went together easily enough except for one locking bolt that did not line up. I had read another reviewers suggestion that I keep a drill handy, and with that and a little persuasion, it came together fine. Even though the wood was treated at the factory, I live in Florida where everything gets old before it's time,so I gave it a treatment with teak oil. It looks great, feels solid and is very comfortable. Great buy for the price.

"A word of warning to ""jazz"" fans: This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real ""blowing"" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion ""smooth"" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available.

This is Getz last recording, and some of his solos are almost unbearably sad. His lyrical inventiveness was never greater though. Getz doesn't embellish the original melody in his solos. He makes comletely new ones of even greater beauty. Here they are often plaintive and full of pain. Jazz artists rarely display this sort of emotional openess. But Getz's technnical skills and Romantic imagination turn all this into high art. Barron, of course, is simply the best jazz pianist around. Together they have produced a truly great album.

I was disappointed. The recorded sound is poor (distant) and the production itself - sets and costumes - is quite odd.For me, decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the 1994 Saison Russe recording.We have been fortunate to have some of Rimsky's operas show up in good to excellent DVD productions: Le Coq d'Or, Sadko, Mlada, Tsar's Bride. Even the quirky and drastically cut Tsar Saltan of Harry Kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry. Let's hope a good Kitezh or Snow Maiden comes along at some point.

While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel.

"Disappointing video.: I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models, the rare trim levels, the more desirable luxury models. As an example, one promo was about the (relative) fuel economy of the Chevrolet Impala compared to it's Ford and Chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track. This is not exactly what I would call an interesting classic car commercial.The segment on the Corvair was okay, so I gave this two-stars. Overall, to me, this wasn't worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a Dodge Polara compared to others in its class.

"can you say CREEPY: Let me say that I had never heard of Diane Arbus before watching this movie. In a nutshell, She meets the stranger living in the attic of her apartment bldg who has a medical condition that makes his appearance that of a werewolf. He is just as creepy as she is. She falls ""madly"" in love with him, takes up photography with the majority of her photos being that of his hallway and front door (yes thats right), neglects her family and becomes weirdly obsessed with her hairy lover. Strange movie. I found it disturbing.
",1,0
"What's the Point?: First of all, why make a film that is an ""imaginary portrait"" of Diane Arbus? It consists of a made-up story about Arbus and a neighbor with a medical condition that makes him hairy all over. Kidman, of course, is wonderful, Robert Downey, Jr. is very disappointing, and ultimately the viewer is disappointed too. I suppose Arbus' real life story wasn't interesting enough.
",1,1
"In-fur-iating: This movie is really quite unfortunate. Diane Arbus was a fascinating woman and her life should have gotten the treatment it deserved. They had been debating for years about how best to approach this... what won out was probably the worst idea. It is fictional and only loosely based on her amazing life. It is pretty insulting to her memory. The fictional allegorical love affair with her upstairs neighbor is kind of insulting for it portrays her as a naive woman needing a masculine figure to bring out her artistic notions. The character itself pays homage to Lionel the Lion-Faced man and imagines a meeting/romance. They even change her kid's names for no reason. I hope another film does it right.

"Natural Selection among people: ----------- -----------1) The mechanism of natural selection among people explained:""the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace one another, so that some finally become extinct""2) The way this encroachment until extinction occurs among people:""Extinction follows chiefly from the competition of tribe with tribe,and race with race. (...) when of two adjoining tribes one becomes less numerous and less powerful than the other, the contest is soon settled by war, slaughter, cannibalism, slavery, and absorption.""3) The morality of Darwinism:""The highest possible stage in moral culture is when we recognise that we ought to control our thoughts, and ""not even in inmost thought to think again the sins that made the past so pleasant to us.""1,2,3 those are the main things in the book in my opinion.

"A Peruvian Portrait of Ordinary Lives: Written 50 years ago, this uniquely-styled novel, with multi-page single paragraph passages apparently used to render community scenes in a unified format seems to me to be a kind of impressionist painting in words, sliding fluidly between a smallish back country city on the edge of the desert and an island village in the upper reaches of the Amazon, with a motley population of mostly poor but proud peasants and indians, some living by smuggling contraband, others by the central elaborate [...] house where an old harp player leads a combo of local musicians. The hopes and fears, successes and failures, of the protagonists translate neither to heroes nor villains, and sad or happy events follow each other in timeless progression. The respected writer produced subsequent superior works, but this difficult effort still deserves patronage.

"A gentle soul was Vincent Van Gogh: Stone takes the reader on a fascinating journey recapping Vincent Van Gogh's life of hardships and triumphs in his biographical novel Lust for Life. Beginning in London, the author reveals Vincent's inner core as a young man of twenty-one working as a clerk for European art dealers while falling madly in love with a vivacious nineteen-year-old kindergarten teacher. Vincent's reaction to this unrequited relationship establishes a pattern of behavior and insight into his personality, which makes him more empathetic as a character. Vincent leaves London and embarks on journey in search of his ""true calling"" and ends up as a minister living in abject poverty in a Belgium miners' village. This situation strengthens his character and weakens his faith, but out of that grows a passion for art and drawing. The obsession begins and so does his real journey.

No where in the book does MS Nichols discuss in any detail the finer points of actually showing your purebred dog. To her benefit she did a very good job of depicting what it is like to attend a dog show and how champions earn their pionts. Unfortunatly, most of this information is not laid out in any organized manner. At times I felt like I was having a friendly cup of coffee as she skipped from one thought to another.

It's a mind-bogglingly stupid tale about a pretty boy (Joshua Jackson) who stupidly decides to join a secret society, and it seems all the members of this society, called The Skulls, are pretty dumb in their own rights, too. Of course, this didn't prepare me for the lame as heck finale, which features a duel, that's right, a duel involving two flintlock pistols.

"Who DOES this remind you of?: Lightweight film, but interesting premise. The sons of wealthy, powerful families get inducted into an Ivy League secret society. In return for a vow of mutual lifetime assistance, they get all sorts of advantages (expensive cars, grad school admissions, forgivable student loans, old boy network at the highest levels of society).Best of all, their darkest secrets are whitewashed, covered up, and forgotten.Darned if this doesn't remind us of a skull currently running for president.

"how not to learn a language: I moved to spain a year ago, but in the 6 months before i left nyc i decided to take a spanish class to give me a head start.my teacher was a native spanish speaker, so i trusted his decision when he required this book. i should'nt have.i quickly realized (after 3 lessons) that you don't learn a foreign language by memorizing list of related vocabulary. i'm sure we all remember that from high school, but how many of us actually learned how to speak a language that way, no one.once in spain and entered in a school with a real book, i realized that you learn by natural assimilation of ideas. A chapter or theme might start with a silly picture or story, and go from there. as the topic is further discussed, it brings in further vocabulary in a way that is natural.memorizing lists works for no one!

"A Great Book to have: Bought this ebook primarily because I was assigned a few of its short story in my North American Writters class. The stories are amazing, my favorite ones are ""Rip Van Winkle"" and of course ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"".This particular edition (The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon) was free on Amazon.com and although it is very well organized and there weren't any errors that I could find, I'm docking one star for a critical flaw on the ebook's design. The table of content is not hyperlinked, so if you just want to read a certain story instead of the whole book you need to go through the entire book ""page"" by ""page"" in order to reach your desired destination. If the table of content had been hyperlinked I would have given it the full 5 stars.

"The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories: The book that I read was called The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow And Other Stories. The author of the book was Washington Irving. I thought that was book wasn't that great. That depends on if you don't mind an old-fashioned type of language that they spoke. I thought that the book was a little too complicated for me because I didn't understand what the people were saying sometimes.I thought that the actual theme of the book was pretty good, but otherwise I didn't really care for it that much.I'd reccomend this book to anyone who ever read the actual verson of Sleepy Hollow and liked the story.By,Andy C.

The acting was terrible, storyline bad, the way the movie was shot was supposed to be ""arty"" but just ended up looking like a 10 year old child did the camera work. I only gave it one star for a rating because they won't let you review an item without one. If they had a zero star rating, that's what it would get. I am sorry I wasted my money on it.

"Read The Club Dumas instead.: I bought this book because I found The Club Dumas to be excellent. I was deeply disappointed. Where The Club Dumas sparkled, The Seville Communion merely exists, and while The Club Dumas transcended its genre, The Seville Communion is deeply rooted in it.

"Yawn: A handsome priest is sent by the Vatican to investigate mysterious goings-on in Seville, after a hacker breaks into the Pope's personal computer and issues a warning that a church there ""kills to defend itself."" The Church, ""Our Lady of Tears"" is slated for demolition, and two people involved in its potential closing have already been killed. Perez-Reverte provides long--I'd say overlong--descriptions both of his characters and of Seville, including, for example, list of the names of 27 bars in one section of the city. I read this book because it was on the list for my book-club. Maybe I'm just not enough of a mystery-lover, but it did nothing for me.

"A Real Pearl: Perez-Reverte disappointed me in the nautical chart book. It was artsy--too many references to books and movies, as if his characters couldn't emerge out of their actions. That's not the case here. His priests are real. That's a lot tougher than creating real cops in this world. And so's his Vatican. Dibden's CABAL works the same vein, but the comparison is all in Perez-Reverte's favor. He's closer here to DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP than to CABAL. Cather gets the 5th star; that's the only reason THE SEVILLE COMMUNION doesn't.

"Don't Bother: I had really grown to enjoy Perez-Reverte's books after first reading some of his other stories such as the Fencing Master, the Flander's Panel, and the Queen of the South. I thought I'd gotten a good bargain by purchasing this book at $.45, but sometimes it's better to hang on to loose change. In this book, the plot was weak from beginning to end, and the climax was unrealistic, even with a stretch of the imagination. I was completely disinterested in the characters whom for the most part were unlikeable, anyway. On several occasions I thought about putting the book down, and had I not been spending a week on the beach with not much else to do, I probably would have. This book gave me the impression that the author was simply trying to fulfill his contract with the publisher to write a certain number of books, regardless of quality, before a certain date.

"Mixture of old & new: ""Haunted Heart"" starts with a blast of recorded film music that my kids recognize from Bugs Bunny. Then, it goes into ""Hello My Lovely"", a Charlie Haden original. Charlie Haden does a similar thing on three songs. His Quartet West plays an instrumental version of the song, then it segues into a clip of a 40's-era vocal version. Jo Stafford sings at the end of ""Haunted Heart"", Jeri Southern at the end of ""Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye"", and Billie Holiday at the end of ""Deep Song"". The Quartet West plays its jazz in a very mainstream fashion. Ernie Watts is a very lush saxophone player -- his generation's Ben Webster. Mix it all together, and it's all quite romantic, though in the melodramatic sense of the word. I'm not a big fan of attaching the old songs onto the end. It doesn't work out as creatively as it should be. Still, it's a good disc, and is about in the middle range of 4-star discs.

"A Book with Some Gorey Details: Heart of a Jaguar book had an O.K. plot, and there were some good parts. However, the gorey parts made the whole book unenjoyable for me. Since many of them are not appropriate to discuss on the internet, I will not give examples - but they were disgusting. Occasionally the characters did inappropriate things, or used profane language.

There are so many errors in this book that I can only successfully complete one pattern (for the granny square afghan).

The problem is that I don't trust the patterns to be correct, and I'm not experienced enough to figure out if they are correct just by looking at them. Perhaps if you are a true expert in crochet, you can figure out how to fix the pattern problems on your own.

"Lives in denial: Having read most books on Krishnamurti, I would give this book only two stars. Lutyens decided not to disclose the extent of the personal relationship even though by her own admission she knew about it from Krishnamurti himself. To that extent Sloss is accurate. However, Sloss is living in complete denial by not acknowledging either the culpability of her father who was a court established embezzler of public funds, not to mention her mother who was a married woman at the time she began her relationship with Krishnamurti. There are some other allegations against Krishnamurti as well but the lack of any objective evidence indicates they are likely a projection of personal bitterness. Sloss has certainly not helped her credibility by waiting for several years after Krishnamurti's death to go public with her version of events that took place many decades earlier.

The people who know something about good writing and therefore know how badly written Eragon is and they are not happy about it.3. The people who think the book is boring and predictable and can't finish it.Personally, I didn't like it because the female characters in Eragon are a joke.

"""I WAS FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK AT GUNPOINT BY FAN-BOY TERRORISTS!"": [...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion.

"Eragon: Have you ever been in a place where Riders and Dragons Rule? The book I'm writing this review about is Eragon, by Christopher Paolini. The book takes place around the medevil ages in the 1600's in early Europe. I would classify the genere of this book as fantasy and adventure because of the dragons and the long journeys. The story is about a young boy named Eragon, who finds a blue stone that's really a dragon egg. Eragon has to battle to save a kingdom with his dragon, Saphira against dark enemies. There is a sequal to Eragon called Eldest and there is currently a movie out based on this book. I like this book because it makes you think about what is happening because the writing is descriptive. I think Eragon is appropriate for middle school and high school students because of the difficult vocabulary. You should read Eragon because it challenges you to believe that what is happening to Eragon is real!

"Childish and too unoriginal: The amazing thing about this book was that it was written by a 15 year old. But the bad thing is that it was horrible. The charactors were so much like LOTR. I felt like this book was too slow paced and lacked action. It also had a very loose story line and lacked any epic feeling. I also felt that is was hard to love the charectors. They all(old or young) had the heart of a 15 year old. Brom,the old wise rider, lacked the wiseness that charectors such as Gandalf had. Overall I hated this book and i dont intend on reading the rest of the series.

"I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old, and this is the first and only book that I have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust. From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Holly Black, Monica Furlong, Susan Cooper, or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans.

"Some southern girl,: Ok i gotta say Christopher's(chris) book Eragon may have given away future plots in the story but you always had to guess when they came.i mean don't you people think it's nice to know how things work?and yes you may be able to tell he was real young when wrote Eragon but for some fantasy books that i've read by 40 year old people Eragon had way way more action.and about the whole crying thing,if you acctually read the book you would understand that Eragon had alot of pain in his life and to top it all off it was all happing at the same time.First with people he loved dieing, and losing good friends for a while.come on people show some sympathy.so to conclude my review I give it a two thumbs up,Chris could have done a little better but that's what practice is for right?But if this goes against what you think DEAL WITH IT!

"Almost Amazing: The story of Eragon has all the makings of being one of the best fantasy books I have ever read. It only falls a little short during the few passages and plot lines that seem forced and don't allow you to get completely sucked into the book. Overall its worth reading.

"Obviously writen by a 15 year old: This book may have a good plot line, but by chapter three I began dreading picking this book up to read each night. I picked this book up because I am an imense Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl fan. I was very disapointed.The subject (and typically the first word) of every sentance in this book is a proper noun. Trying to keep track of the he, she, they and its quickly became annoying. Also, the author can't mention any inatomate object without giving you several long metaphores or symolies to describe it.This book reads as though it was writin by someone who has never heard of any literay devices other than symolies and metaphores and believes writing a good story means cramming as many of them into it as humanly possible. Sometimes less is more.

"Eragon Book Review: This book was wonderfully imaginative and captivating. It contains all the elements that a fantasy reader could want and more. The action, emotional features, and the bonds of friendship are so clearly shown that it is nearly impossible for a person not to get caught up in it all.Christopher Paolini brings out the hero in his brave, yet young, character, Eragon. Paolini shows us how destiny controls our lives and that we have to accept who we are, no matter how much we wish otherwise. In the end, we may have bigger plans made for us in our lives than we ever could have made for ourselves. Christopher Paolini, my thanks for the wonderful journey!

"I Love this Book!: Wow! This was a great book. I anticipate the rest of the trilogy. I'm a fan of Pern and when Anne McCaffery had rave reviews of Eragon, I had to buy it. I have not been disappointed. I highly recommend this book and intend to have my 9 year old son read it starting this weekend! I am normally a very slow reader but I was finished with this tome in less than 4 days, something of a record for me! My congratulations to Mr. Paolini! I can hardly wait for more!

"Hmmm: This is alright for a beginner but, I hope his next book improves greatly, otherwise I will not even bother to read the third one.One thing that bugs me about this book is that the author seemed to keep changing his mind about almost everything! For instance, his dragon. She keeps almost changing shape! She's supposed to be so huge and strong but can't carry three people. She flies way up in the air one day, but the next day she can't breathe that high. It makes no sense. Its as if the author keeps switching from one story to another.I don't think it was written well.

"A knockoff--yeah, but I liked it!: Ok, so its obvious Paolini was a Tolkien fan, and his descriptions of elves and dwarves come right out of middle earth, but I couldn't help it, I liked his story. As it progressed, I found myself checking his map and seeing exactly where his characters where and where they were going and I was hooked. Although I could tell a teenager, albeit a talented one, wrote this book, I thought Paolini's writing and plot got more polished the more I got into it. I'll be reading the next one for sure, and I'm not even a kid, just a middle aged housewife. I am sure any young reader would love this story!

"Cliched, derivative, passable: Eragon is a fantasy novel written by Christopher Paolini. He started when he was fifteen, and finished when he was nineteen, which is truly a noteworthy accomplishment. This book has been hailed as a phenomenon, and has become an international bestseller. But honestly, I wrack my brain trying to understand how and why. For those who have read and love Eragon, I hope you become exposed to real fantasy and science fiction soon. For those of you who haven't read this, let me make a suggestion: read Lord of the Rings, and watch the original Star Wars trilogy. You'll know all you need to know about Eragon, and you'll save your money.

"Needs works: I picked up this book based on some of the hype generated around Paolini. While I have to agree with some of the other reviews regarding the writing style and the portions of the story which are influenced from some very geat Authors. Even though Paolini has taken plot lines from other Authors I will wait to see where these stories end up. I don't want to trash his first effort completely and look forward to seeing what the next volume has in store. Hopefully, the editing issues can be resolved by then.

"Not too great: this book is a major acomplishment for a 15-16 year old, but so much stuff is ripped off of LOTR. It's really predictable and you can see what will happen chapters early if you are 13+ years old. what really bugs me is that Paolini describes EVERY SINGLE THING in the book. i mean, do we really NEED to know what all the unimportant characters look like with so much choppy detail??? also, sometimes the characters speak like it's Middle Earth, and sometimes they speak like it's Today.

"Had he been much older, I doubt this would have been published.: Sure, it's good for a 17-year-old, but that doesn't make it good literature. I think I've seen fan fiction better than this.So many elements of the plot, locations, even names are almost shamelessly derived from other works of fantasy, such as 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. I read this in 6th grade and, of course, loved it. Now I've gone back, re-read it, and it's almost painful, how so much of this over praised purple brick is clearly written by a kid. It's good for a 17-year-old, sure, but to me, that doesn't save it from being mediocre.Nonetheless, if he keeps this up, Paolini shows great promise at an older age. But for now, I'd much rather read Philip Pullman's 'His Dark Materials', or anything by Tolkein,instead this overrated purple brick of a fantasy novel. Kids will probably love it, but anyone older will probably be able to see through it.

"I Could Write A Better Book: The only thing that grabs any attention to the ""Inheritance"" series is that Paolini is only 17. If the exact same book was written by a 40-year-old, the book would have sold about 50 copies. The book is completely a ripoff of good sci-fi stories and the plot makes no sense. No sense whatsoever. Do us all a favor and buy a Get Fuzzy comic book. PEACE OUT!LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY

"Best fantasy book ever: Despite what other people have said about this book, it is most likely the best fantasy book that I have EVER read! The people that complained about his language and choice of words obviously didn't read the book that I read. His vocabulary in this book was OUTSTANDING! I can't believe that he is only 19! And, just because he knows to use other words besides 'said' doesn't make the book tacky!!!!! I think that its awesome that he uses rich vocab. Many books written by accomplished authors don't even write as well as this man did!!! I can't believe that people could criticize a book and dislike it just because he has wonderful vocabulary in this book. The people whom criticized it probably are just upset and jealous because they didn't know what the words meant and don't have that good of a vocabulary. This book is awesome with a deep plot, developed characters, and tense battles. Read it!!!!!!!!!!!

"don't leave me hanging: I just could not get this book. I was so confused with this made up language and the the main character drove me nuts! Is he this great dragon rider who can use magic, or is he a pouty teenager from the 21st century.When I got to the end I was so upset because I felt that there was so much that has been left unanswered. I felt that I was left hanging with some important issues, such as Eragons parents. It seemed to me that at the begining of the book he cared a great deal with wanting to know about his parents, especially his dad. But when it was discussed later on in the book Eragon never tried to find out any information. Especially when the character Brom talked about his mother and the fact that he knew her. Which led me to come up with my own speculation of...was Brom his father? Who knows because nothing was revealed.

"Copy-cat: Overall I thought Eragon was a pretty good book. I liked the way Paolini described the land, people, and dragons. Although, he needs to learn to be more original. I can see getting your inspiration from a book (The Lord of the Rings) but this is just taking it too far. Paolini is obviously talented so he should use his talent and creat something of his own!Eragon needs to stop being so inquisitive. Some of his questions that are needed to describe things could be answered through the story instead of by the characters. The story has an okay plot line and I am eager to see where it takes Eragon. But advice for Paolini on future books, use your imagination and do something original! It's easy to imitate other books but it takes talent to come up with something new.

"Exquisite and Riveting: When I had first heard of the book, I thought it would be a ridiculously confusing science fiction fantasy book that was not worth the trouble of reading. However, I gave in and checked it out form the library after my curiousity rose when I saw its unpublished sequel being sold on amazon. I am very glad I did. Eragon staisfied my appetite for a good, decent, and understandable story about dragons, and Eragon and Saphira. I enjoyed the plot development and the creativity Paolini put into making the story and its world seem real and fascinating. I wait patiently and curiously for the second book of the trilogy, Eldest, which I hope will be as good or exceed Eragon. Loved it and recommend it to all fantasy-genre lovers. Enjoy!

"boring and, well, boring.: I believe that my title says it all but I will add a little more. If you have read this book you might have noticed that the main charactor, Eragon, is knocked out during all but one battle scene. From this I conclude that the author is a wimp and is too frightened to write out the details of a battle. Don't read this book and read the Tolkien books instead.

"Don't let the rave reviews fool you!: Like many, our family bought this book and the next based on the glowing reviews of the many readers. Unfortunately, we were in for quite a shock as these are the most unimaginative, poorly written books ever published. At Borders where I returned all four books we purchased (2 copies of Eragon and 2 of Eldest), there was a pile of returned copies of Eldest behind the counter. I was in fact unable to get a refund, instead I got store credit on a gift card.Eragon is an uninspiring story chock full of tired, overused characters. The prose is unimaginative, very wordy, and fails miserably on all levels. Each characters talks just like every other character. I don't know why everyone said this book was so good. My kids are in tears. Thanks a lot Chris Paolini for ruining our last week of summer break!

"An entertaining read: Is it the same world that others made up? Yes, that's true. There's little originality in Eragon's universe.Is the prose below the level of Tolkien? Obviously. It is on par with Robert Jordan, which I think is decent enough, as Eragon is merely another fantasy novel and not an epic work.Is the plot completely and utterly predictable? It is so predictable that the complete plotline of the entire trilogy is spelled out in a fortune-telling early on.But is it entertaining? Yes!If you can settle for the penultimate.. if you can enjoy a book for its vividness and adventure, even if it wasn't written by an Oxford scholar... then you will love Eragon. It is not /Lord of the Rings/-- it is /Harry Potter/.

"Time for Credibility/Reality check??: The reason people claim to love this book is because it was supposedly written by a kid. Definitely time for some truth in martketing Knopf. Paolini is at this time 22 years old. If I do the math and go back 2 years that makes him 19 or 20 when Eragon was published. A 19 year old is not a kid. So why market this book as written by a kid? Only reason I can figure is since the book could not be sold otherwise. As for litery quality or merit this book has none. I didn't dislike it due to the fact it was derivative. I disliked it because it was contrived, poorly written, and lacking any redeeming quality. Parents before letting your kids read this think twice about the poor example being set.

"Geez.............: As other reviewers have alredy stated, Eragon Does draw too much from other much better works of fantasy. What I noticed the most though, was how much was taken from David Edding's ""Belgariad"". The stories are so alike. Eragon is a farm boy, just like Garion. Eragon is an orphan, just like Garion. Eragon befriends a storyteller who turns out to be a sorcerer, Just like garion. Eragon does magic in the same way Garion does, through ""The will and the word"".I could go on and on. I think Paolini counted on the fact that most people haven't read Edding's masterpiece. One of the only resons his book sold so well was because he was so young when he started writing it.Also, the dialogue is stupid, and it is obvious that he tries to make his writing sound impressive through flowery writing style.

To anyone who enjoys a good story, read this tale of elves, dwarves, dragons, trolls, hobbits, and wizards. Also, if you choose to read this novel, don't forget to read the even better Lord of the Rings Trilogy by the same author. Remember to read this first, however. Don't listen to the other reviews which state that this book is a load of hogwash. It is, in fact, a wonderful adventure that a reader will never forget.

"There and back again, a Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins: This is the story of Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit, of Bag End, Under Hill, Hobbiton. The story tells of how Bilbo came to be involved in the dwarves mission to travel to The Lonely Mountain, defeat Smaug (the dragon) and retrieve their treasures and their homeland. It's a great tale of survival through untold hardships, when all seems to have failed, and yet, a little luck, and a little perseverance sees them through.The Hobbit is a great introduction into Tolkein's world and a great set up for the Lord Of The Rings. I highly recommend it.

"What a HORRIBLE book.: I just don't see how everyone loves this book. It is a *never ending* tale of Bilbo Baggins and his 'journey' with the wizard and dwarves. J.R.R. Tolkien is a quite horrible writer...the story goes on and on and on, continuing with them hiding in a cave, fighting a dragon, or another thing of that sort. I am a pre-teenager and I still cannot focus on it because of its pure stupidity.

"Amazing:): I have read this book several times and it seems to get better each time! I love this story! Very different tone than the Lord of the Rings, after learning more about JRR Tolkien it makes total sense. The Hobbit was written to a younger audience who would be adults by the time Lord of the Rings was published. Amazing, talk about attention to detail.Read this book if you haven't yet, it is simply fantastic. There is beautiful imagery, sword fights, dragons and trolls, what's not to love.

"Don't buy the audiobook: Please note that this review is specifically about the non-BBC audiobook version.I adore ""The Hobbit."" My first memory of my father is hearing him read the first page of the book to me as a very young child, and I've read the book countless times since then. Given my long commute currently, I've become a big fan of audiobooks. I picked this up with high hopes.What a let down. The audiobook is abridged, although the package didn't note that anywhere, the abridgement choices are odd at best (leave in Beorn but take out almost everything of Rivendell?), the voice actors seem to be interested in portraying the characters as comically and unpleasantly as possible (I want to give all of the elves in the audiobook some throat lozenges) and to top it all off, the sound quality is incredibly poor and inconsistent....

"Hobbit: I really liked this book. The beginning was kind of slow, but if you keep on reading you can't put it down. I really like how he used the main character as a hobbit (or really small person), instead of this tall, masculine person, who works on a farm, and all the chicks dig him, because people like that have ""a really hard time proving themselves"".That why I like The Hobbit, because Bilbo proved himself even though he's three foot tall.It shows us that height and weight have nothing to do with our character. We could be four foot five and two hundred pounds outside, but a seven foot high one hundred forty pound body builder inside.

"Am I missing something?: I read ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy before the movies came out in anticipation of them, having always put them off for one reason or another. Naturally I was drawn to this book afterwards as a way of looking for some of the background to the story. Honestly, I don't know what it is and hate myself for saying this, but I simply did not like this book. I'm not sure if it's the style of the narration or what it is, but I found it a struggle to read. I normally read until the end of a chapter and then stop for the time being, but with The Hobbit I found I could barely get through one chapter in a sitting. I know that many are going to hammer me as ""not helpful"" for knocking the book, but I just want readers to understand that this book, much like LOTR, is not for everyone. The LOTR is a much better read than this one, and in my opinion The Hobbit is really only a necessary read for those diehard fans who really need to know where it all began.

"Great book to a Great Series...: First off I gave this book a four because, in my opinion, it was not as good as Lord of the Rings which I proudly would rate a five. Writers mature, getting better in their writing style on their second/third book. Tolkien did a fabulous job on the Hobbit. Humor, confilct, but no romance. Good for children, good for just anyone. I thought Bilbo to be hilarous, the dwarfs just as funny. A true classic was the Hobbit that it will remain on my ""read again"" books forever, until I die of course. If you haven't read it yet I highly recommed for anyone who is looking for a good book to try this one out. I know others have said it, and I won't be the last but Tolkien was a master writer of our time!!

"Some people...: Do you find it interesting that all the people giving this excellent book a rating of one have dozens of spelling and grammar errors in their reviews? I think that is just about the least shocking thing I have ever seen. And can anyone tell me where the schools that ""make"" students read Tolkien are? At my school we have to read crap like ""The Scarlet Letter"". I am jealous of you people who were ""forced"" to read this book! In the sixth grade my teacher suggested that I read ""The Hobbit"" and L.O.T.R. Since then I have been a Fantasy MANIAC! I followed it up with Terry Brooks and Death Gate and I haven't stopped yet. I owe it all to The Hobbit! How could anyone not like this book?

"A Fine Beginning: While Tolkien was nowhere near as excellent of a writer at this point as he would become years later with the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit is still an enjoyable introduction to Middle Earth. The story is more simple and the flow is more like reading a fable or children's story to me compared with the more serious and high fantasy style of the Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is more fast paced. There is more action happening all the time but it's not as atmospheric. This is the story of Bilbo joining a band of dwarves to go get treasure from a dragon named Smaug. Along the way he braves many dangers such as orcs, trolls, giant spiders and meets Gollum and finds a ring. It's a good prelude but nothing amazing. However, the book does hold a special place for me because I found a copy in my parents book collection in the basement when I was a kid and it became the first book I ever read. I owe Tolkien a thank you for hooking me on books.

"great but not outstanding: I enjoyed Anderson's book, especially the background into Tolkien's sources and early writings that is invaluable. I must say I have read the Hobbit at least 100 times and yet I have never enjoyed reading it as much as when I read it with Anderson's anotations. I especially appreciated the philological background into the many proper names and archaic words that Tolkien used. What is a ""carrock""or what does ""confusticate and bebother"" mean? Now I know!I also enjoyed the immense number of illustrations that were included, many of them sketches and pictures made by J.R.R himself. Alas, they are not in color, most are black and white prints of original color pictures. If more had been invested in the visual quality of this book, it would have greatly added to the level of pleasure in the words of Tolkien that Anderson's comments bring out. Still worth the money, hopefully Anderson will add color in the next edition

"Somewhat Overrated: The Hobbit is considered a literary classic for the fantasy standards it created, and though there's a wonderful story here (the Riddles in the Dark chapter with Gollum is particularly exciting), but I was turned off by the quick writing style that emphasizes innane background details and cordially dances past what could have been epic sequences. For example, we get a full paragraph or two describing Bilbo's Hobbit hole, yet a measly sentence or so describing a battle in a thunderstorm between giant rock monsters. The Hobbit is an imporant piece, and many will undoubtedly love it, but I found it difficult to enjoy.

"Great for kids learning about J.R.R Tolkien: My 7 yr old son became interested in the Hobbit after a Lego catelog showed up with Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themed lego sets. He tried to read my copies of the LOTR and the Hobbit, but it was a little to much for him. I was excited to find a graphic novel version of the Hobbit. The pictures are engaging and keep to the spirit of the story. I know it misses some details that you will only get from reading the originals, if he loves the story as much as I do then he will eventually read the full length novels when he is older.

"Adventure, Thrill, Treasure .... A delightful tale of fantasy.: The Hobbit is different from Lord of the Rings. Firstly its short but equally interesting. The Hobbit takes you to the wonderful world of Mr. Bilbo Baggins ( the hobbit) and how he is swayed away to the world of Adventure. It has everything a fantasy book should have - Trolls, Goblins, Elves, Wizard and of course the magic ring.I loved the book because it keeps you hooked from the first page and keeps the excitement right till the end. It's descriptive and a light read .All throughout history , we human beings have been fascinated of being Invisible - Invisible Man, Hollow Man, LOTR and of Course The Hobbit. The beauty of the book lies in the presentation and the creativity of J R R Tolkien.Enjoyable 320 page read with a good adventure and strong story.

"An amazing novel: I am sure there are many reviews for this book already, but I will heap more praise upon Tolkien's genius. The Hobbit relates the reader to the character. The story is also adventurous and exciting. I remember the first time I read the book in fifth grade, it thrilled me then, as it thrills me now when reading for the third time. A land of hobbits, dwarves, dragons, and wizards. The adventure is suspenseful and well worth the time. After reading the rest of Tolkien's books, I appreciate the Hobbit even more. It is a small part of his work, but the detail he uses to weave a creative plot is astounding.

I honestly don't care which of the 5000 races of little people someone belongs to. This book had a few highly actioned and interresting parts in the book, but overall this book is dull, and Bilbo the main charachter complained most of the time.For instance, there was often a large gap between action scenes. I was really looking up to the death of Smaug, a charachter who's ego was expanded into godlike preportions, died a pitiful death, with hardly any contact with the adventuring gang. And finally, my favorite charachter(Gandalf)left prematurely.

"A Disappointment: I'm going to make this short and sweet. What a disappointment. I also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset I almost but a match to it. The ending left me wanting to throw it out the window. I loved all the previous books but like other reviewers I found myself skipping page after page searching for some ""action"". I'm hoping the next one will be better. Usually I buy the hard copy. I may wait and get it from the library.

"Very disappointing: If ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" was as mediocre as this book, its likely that the series would have ended right there. ""Clan"" was an excellent book -- and the others in the series were also very good -- but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom. The detailed research, which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events, appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story. As an Auel fan, I've eagerly read all of the previous books in this series, and was hoping that the negative reviews on ""Shelters"" were exaggerated. Sad to say, they're not. The only positive thing about this book is that Auel fans will have a chance to re-enter Ayla's world again after a long wait. I'm hoping that the next book will be better...

"Dissapointment: AFter waiting so long I felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence. Ayla reaches final destination, mates, and has Jondalar's baby.

"Fans only: What is this series? I guess it is romance, in the same genre as those thick novels with a woman and Fabio on the cover. If one starts this book with that in mind, you won't be disappointed. It still has Ayla inventing everything and healing everyone, and Jondalar is still an amusingly dumb blond with one endearing attribute. The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France. Auel still manages to make sex scenes tiresome -- singlehandedly she may keep teenagers from having sex because she makes it seem so boring.But a fun bubble-head read nonetheless. Smart of the publisher to release this book in May -- it is the perfect beach read.

"A 12 Year wait and this is the best she could do?: Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over?

"Tedious: Boring and tedious! Repetitious story line both from earlier books and from within this story -- how many times do you have to tell Ms Auel, I'm not stupid, you know. Hard-to-remember names, and an error-ridden Kindle transcription add to this reader's frustration. I'm new to Kindle and wonder if all Kindle books are subject to transcription errors or did someone forget to edit this one? Tell you what, Amazon, let me be an advance reader, give me the titles for free and I'll edit for you.

"Same old, same old...but worse: Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250. It is all review. Auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend 250 pages re-hashing what we already know. We already know people will be ""amazed"" and ""disbelieving"" of Ayla's and Jondalar's previous adventures. We do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of Jondalar's relatives.We also already know Ayla and Jondalar ""share pleasures"" more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could. I am not reading this story to get a ""thrill"". In the last book, it got to the point that whenever Auel wrote about pleasures, I just skipped it, because it disturbed the flow of the story. This book was no exception.I want more depth, more story and less review. I haven't given up on the series yet, but if I have to wait another 10 years for the next - I won't be buying it.

"I waited HOW LONG for THIS?: After waiting with great anticipation for 12 looonnggg years, I actually took the day off work when my copy arrived so I could immerse myself back in the Ice Age! 300 pages later, I gave up and decided to clean house instead. I now know why the book has the shortened title of SoS - 'cause if I EVER saw a book in distress this is it! I am now perfectly willing to believe all those rumors that Jean is dead - she couldn't possibly have written this drivel.(well actually she did, it was just in books 1-4) This has been my favorite series of all time and now, sadly, I don't care if she ever gets around to publishing book 6. Even Ayla's skills as a medicine woman can't revive this victim.

"Slooooooow: I was a big fan of Auel, right until this book arrived. It's approximately 700 pages long and it took nearly 500 pages before it starts to get interesting. I skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book. I'll probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends. Hopefully Auel won't let us down. If this book was half the length it would potentially have been great. I was disappointed.

"Bad graphic design.: The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers.

"Tedious: Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation.

"The Shelters of Stone: My teenage daughter and I both enjoyed reading this series.

"Kindle edition rife with typos: I was excited to have the Earth's Children series available for my Kindle, but the OCR errors in ""Shelters of Stone"" make it almost unreadable. Surely SOMEONE must review the copy before the book is made available for sale? The quality of the story notwithstanding (the plot rather drags, as others have noted), it's incredibly distracting to come across so many mistakes in the text when trying to read the story. Publishers need to institute better quality control when issuing Kindle editions of old manuscripts.

"Extremely boring and repetitious: I used to be a huge fan of Ayla to the point that I even read the first three books more than once. The fourth book however didn't attract me as much until I had read 200 pages. I find Auel's latest book very boring simply because there is nothing new in the book. The rest of the reviewers explain perfectly how this book has nothing offer so I won't repeat their comments.I wouldn't recommend this book to any friend.

"The Shelters of Stone: Remembering way back when this series started with The Clan of the Cave Bear, how well and entertaining that and the following books were....till many years later when this book came out, and then the entertainment just stopped and it became a boring read, I lost all interest in the characters.I truly did try to read it through, but I just couldn't do it. I had to stop half-way through. Maybe it was just too long between books, or maybe I've just outgrown the writing.
",1,1
"Brainless dribble!: Perhaps I was expecting too much, given the long wait since book four, and considering that I thoroughly enjoyed the other four books in the series. However, this book for me was nothing but a brain dulling barrage of introductions and recaps of the other books in the series. In fact, I must admit that I did not finish reading this book. After 200 pages of pure ""nothing,"" I finally decided to discard it. I had help with this decision, though. A good friend of mine began listening to the book on tapes at the same time I began reading. She finished--only because she has a long commute and nothing better to do--and quickly informed me that absolutely ""nothing"" happens, that there is no drama, action, or any form of brain teasing within the pages of this new book from Jean Auel.

"A cure for insomnia: This book is a real snooze. I plan to keep it near my nightstand for the next 12 years - just in case I have trouble dozing off. I loved Clan of the Cave Bear and really enjoyed the next 3 books, but this book is nothing more than a 700 page description of the way the continent of Europe looked 30,000 years ago. BORING stuff. As for the brilliant Ayla, she is relegated to a pathetic shell of her former self. I agree with all the other reviewers about the boring sex scenes, rehash of the Clan ways, etc. etc. That hunt on the 2nd day (page 250 thru 280 or so) was very contrived. They were so greedy they had to have 2 hunts? This was done more to show off Ayla's skill and Jondular's spear than to entertain the reader. It seems that way too much in this book is just 'filler'. I will not run out and buy the sixth book Ms. Auel. When I hear it's been published, I'll re-read Clan of the Cave Bear.
",1,1
"Agree with ""Just A Reader"": The author is obsessed with her exploration of the historic sights and forces descriptions of minutiae on us that add nothing to the story; in fact, they take the place of character development and divert the story line.As much as I liked the first three in the series, I put this one down for good just over half through. I would give NO stars if the rating system allowed that.

"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK: Like everyone else, I waited for tweleve years for this book.. and I ran out and bought it as soon as I could.I want my money and my nine hours back.The characters are bland. There was no plot, no twists, and just about nothing happening that wasn't either easy to foresee or a rehash of books one through four.Wait till book six comes out, then pick this one up in paperback and skim it. Trust me, I'm trying to save you the anguish of characters you can't get into, events that are just plain silly, and the endless retelling of events that you don't need to be told about if you bothered to read the rest of the series.

"*sigh* I guess it couldn't last forever: No one is a bigger fan of ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" than I am - I've read it cover-to-cover at least 10 times since 1996. And the same goes for the others in the series (especially ""The Mammoth Hunters"") which were all really great. I will not be rereading ""Shelters,"" I'm sorry to say. I got the impression that the whole story, inflated to over 700 pages, could have easily fit in the first 100 pages of the next book. All the conflict built up to in the last few books - especially the very big question of the Zelandonii's acceptance of Ayla and her Clan background and son - were dismissed entirely. Oops, I guess Jondalar didn't have reason to be worried after all. Kind of makes you wonder why he almost left her behind out of fear of his people's reaction. There's no story here - just constant introduction and repetition. Read it only if you plan to read the 6th, so you won't be lost in a maze of characters.

"What happened?: I eagerly awaited the coming of this book but after reading it I am sorry I wasted my time. There were so many chances for drama that were missed, so many segments that did nothing to advance the story. What little bit of action that did happen was so weak that is wasn't even action! It seemed to me this book was just a comercial for the next book. The first 4 books are well worth a second read, but this one should be forgotten.

"Like a Seinfeld Episode....: ...this is a book about nothing. Ms. Auel really phoned this one in, and I couldn't be more disappointed. My advice, if you haven't started the series, is to read the first three, skip four and five, and hope six lives up to the first half of the series. Unless you want a slightly less boring version of a research paper on the topography of Europe 30,000 years ago, stay away. I think it took her twelve years because she kept dozing off.... I NEVER have written a comment on a book before. The only reason I felt compelled to do so now is, after all the anticipation, I feel cheated and let down. Of course, who cares, because of course I'll buy the sixth one too, just to see if things look up. Still, I think I'll wait till it gets to the 2nd-hand store next time.
",1,1
"Enough already?: Only reason to continue the series at this point would be to see how many more pages it takes for Ayla to invent The Wheel (and is anyone else as irritated as I am by the constant capitalized spellings for nearly every activity from ceremonies to having sex?) Seriously, I can guess why Auel is constantly rehashing material from earlier books--to hide the lack of a story or interesting new characters--and I had particularly looked forward to meeting Zelandoni, the previous great love of Jondalar's life. For an entertaining and far quicker read on the subject of Stone Age life, read Joan Wolf's trilogy(Daughter of the Red Deer, The Horsemasters, The Reindeer Hunters). I've recently reread the book, and while still giving only two stars, I must say that it reads faster the second time around--maybe because of knowing which segments to skip over altogether!

"WOULD THE REAL JEAN AUEL STAND UP: Would the real Jean Auel stand up. This book,THE SHELTERS OF STONE, seems like the author had three people read the other books in this series and then had them each pen the chapters. It is a great drop below her other books. No real finality to the problems that were introduced in the last book. And with the new problems introduced in this book, the reader is left with a sense of loss. No closure to Ayla's pain about Durc. No meeting among the Clan and the Zelandonii. Ayla has to be able to strut her stuff for the good of her new people.

"Ties up loose ends: I gave it five stars because I liked it. I considered giving it four stars because I don't think this book will hold much for a person who hasn't read the previous books in the series. It ties up loose ends and sets up an interest for upcoming adventures, but it doesn't carry a lot of excitement of its own. Obstacles are too easily overcome. This book works well as a step in a larger series, but I don't think it could stand on its own.

"Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Jr. Library Ed.: I'm sure there are plenty of reviews on the actual story, so I'll just comment on this particular edition of Little Women. I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection.

"A Great Book: This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, ""Marmee"" goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other.

"Enjoyable Family Movie: I had never read or even heard of the book so I was able to approach this movie with no bias at all. I found the movie to be pleasant and enjoyable. The roles were all convincingly played and I found myself really mad at the Scott Wilson character, Judd Travers; Wilson did a great job at being a despicable villain. The other major and supporting roles are well cast and played by seasoned actors and actresses which contribute to the overall ambience of the movie.Blake Heron plays the part of Marty Preston, our stories hero, and is convincing as the young lad who falls in love with a dog. The dog is in trouble and turns to Marty for help; Marty reacts to the need and decides the dog is his responsibility. That decision is the beginning of Marty's time of testing that will lead to an ending that won't disappoint.This is a first class family movie and one the entire family will enjoy.

"A bad film adaptation of a great book: It really is sad to see Phills Reynold Naylor's great masterpiece about a beagle puppy trampled on like this. This film was not at all faithful to the book. The first difference is that in the book Shiloh had a black spot just behind his left ear about one inch in front of his leg. In the movie, the spot is way over on his back! In the book, Shiloh's tail was a couple inches long. In the movie, it's like a foot!The classic ""this little piggy goes to market"" scene has been ommitted, and scene where Shiloh tries to hump the kid's leg was just plain unneccesary. C'mon, this is supposed to be a family movie! Avoid this and read the fantastic book trilogy instead(which I also wrote a comprehensive review for)

"Very good but doesn't follow book: We loved the movie very much...my 9 and 5 year old girls loved it, especially the ending. We didn't find it too scary at all.However, both my 9 year old and I enjoyed the book far more...it gave such a deeper insight into Marty's heart, and into the world of a boy and his dog. We were both very affected by the book; it made an impression on us that the movie did not.I especially did not like the addition of another child, a girl, into the story. It seemed Hollywood wanted to add a little childhood flirting to make the movie more sellable. That just served as a distraction from this fine story. There were many differences from the book, but this was the one that irked me.It still was a very good movie with a heartwarming ending. If you haven't read the book, you'll like it even more cause you won't be comparing differences.

Classics like this, which have already survived the test of time, tend to get picked up by two-bit distributors and released in the most disgraceful of manners. Thank god for the Criterion Collection; This lavish transfer will not disappoint those with a healthy aesthetic. Reading a lot of the other reviews, I've noticed that they've mentioned something about the sound quality: it's true, even in the newly restored edition there are some imperfections, but I don't think that is enough to merit less than 5 stars (maybe 4.5, but that's not an option.)

But do make a point of reading VICSARJOO's review, for a delicious satire of over-blown and mis-guided reviews. If you enjoy that review (one of my favorites) there are some other classics by him if you link to his other reviews, though some seem a little half-hearted compared to this review by him.

"Excellent: Finally such an amazing movie appears on DVD! It is no wonder Ingrid Bergman won the Academy Award for this film. She is spectacular as an abused wife, driven mad by her husband.The ONLY reason I gave it 4-stars is because you can get it cheaper somewhere else. The actual publisher's list price is $14.99 and I'm not entirely sure why Amazon offers it for almost $2 more. This is the same with the Masterpiece Edition Alice in Wonderland. Amazon lists the price as $29.99, but in stores the list price is $24.99. Curiouser and curiouser.

"Absolutely mesmerizing: I bought this movie based on a recommendation made to me years ago that I had completely forgotten. What a waste of time. I haven't seen a movie this engrossing in many, many years. The acting is superb and you just can't believe what you're seeing, or take your eyes from it. In the age of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and similar movies where sex is used so freely to capture your attention, it is refreshing to see pure acting and story-telling keep your eyes wide open and fixed on the movie. Highly recommended!

"Interesting: This is a very interesting movie, considering that now the term ""gaslight"" is being used to describe a form of abuse. I had never known what it was until a friend mentioned it a while back and then another friend recently mentioned this movie. I was delighted to watch it here on Amazon and do love the old black and white movies. The setting is so wonderfully done & the acting is marvelous. This is overall a good movie to watch, regardless of the form of abuse and message being sent across.

"iNCREDIBLY STUPID FILM: This film really made me angry and pissed off I bothered watching it. The characters were cardboard and I can't believe Ingrid Bergman starred in this junk.The main character totally lost it, believing all what her husband was saying about her. She was totally unthinking in the whole episode until it was revealed that her husband was a con.

"I have to say this!!!: There are already over twenty reviews of this movie at this site, but I had to put my two cents worth in.Gaslight is the earliest of Bergman's works I have seen.We know from studies on facial expression and nonverbal communication that the face is difficult to read because of the rapidity of movement of the many features of the face...eyes, mouth, checks, chin. But I swear, watching this film makes me believe that Bergman could command the movement of her hair folicles and skin pores. There are facial movements in this film that absolutely cannot be seen with the naked eye. It appears that she has not moved a muscle yet she has conveyed a powerful emotion.That's why Bergman must be in the top ten actresses of all times.The story was good, but watching Ingrid was superb!

"You Know What They Say About Sequels: I loved ""The List of 7"", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment. The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story. It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. This is not a book I will read again.

"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT: I thought the author couldn't do worse than his job with The List of 7--how wrong I was! The 6 Messiahs is an endless stream of predictable moments and horrible plot development.

I still believe Frost has the potential for great exciting fiction, but somehow he fails to deliver.

"The Best Clarke You'll Probably Never Read: This book is out of print and pretty hard to find, but if you ever come across a copy of it I highly reccommend you pick it up. It is a masterpiece of speculative essays. In it, Clarke accurately predicts many things... of course lots of things about space and satellite communications, and even an accurate description of the internet! Also of note are essays on what we should do if we have contact with an alien race, a debunking of UFO sightings (much needed), a debunking of the cliche ""nothing is impossible"" with a listing of things that are, much talk on the speed of light and relativity, and of course a lot about space. The two most interesting essays in my view are one that speculates on what the Star of Bethleham (Clarke settles on a supernova). Also, there is the short essay ""God and Einstein"" which is one of the most thought-provoking things I have ever read in my life. Highly reccommended.

"Me quede aterrada con ese final: Isabel Allende tiene una forma unica y peculiar de escribir. Me gustan mucho sus libros, pero tiene un problema: da demasiados detalles y se sale de la trama. Esta era una fantastica historia, sin embargo, no le dio la importancia que debio darle al personaje. Se intereso mas en describir la vida en chile y otras cosas que le restaban importancia a lo que verdaderamente la tenia: la historia de Eliza. No es que no me haya gustado, si me gusto, pero el final es algo tragico e inesperado. Me quede con las ganas de saber que paso despues.

So I was not able to get satisfaction via that route either.May be a good idea to just ...go- and get a iPod for Mac or PC.The buttons on the Yepp are difficult to use unless you have tiny fingers, the rocker switch slips and it's easy to depress the play function while rocking, confusing your input. The remote is cool though. The FM Tuner worked medium-well.

"No one did it better: In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable.

"A Very True Side of Human Nature: Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece.

"In repsonse to ""A reader from St. Louis, MO"": You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a ""loser"" - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it.

"didn't live up to my expectations: I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book.

"You can never go wrong with Dickens: How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his ""great expectations"" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted ""daughter"" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best.

"BO-RING!: This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond ""I'm rich and you're not,"" and ""Oh, how I do love the lady Estella."" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring.

I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation. While some themes are mildly interesting, there were no scenes that captured my attention or held it for any period of time. This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old. Sucks sucks sucks.Note to Teachers and Principals, please don't assign this to your high school students. There are so many better and more captivating books.

"Classical Literature: Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read. The way that the book was put together always left you wanting to know more. The book was told by a young boy named Phillip Pirrup, that falls madly in love with a young lady name Estrella. He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

"Long, entertaining Dickens story for the car.: I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now. A recommended story.

"still a classic: Don't waste the classics on kids. I remember having to read and write book reports on musty old classic books in school, dull and boring. Now I am ready to enjoy these books. Great Expectations shows how much of our lives are lived on incomplete information. The hero assumes that he knows who is guiding and helping him to live and grow beyound his simple beginnings, only to discover at the end that nothing he assumed was true. The hero does live up to the expectations of his benefactor, and beyond the expectations of many others. He also finds out what it is to be given a better future and how much you owe to those that believe in you. I enjoyed this story and recomend you read (reread) this enlighting story of growing up.

"Profoundly worthless.: Just think of all the trees cut down to make all the additions of this classicly boring novel. This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself. The fool author made it up as he went along not caring if it made sense or if the characters had any meaning. I hate this novel with a passion so great it scares even me. I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse.

"Finally, some clarity!: I have a pile of XML books on my desk. They all seem to assume too much or assume to little. Those written at my level appear to be written with the ""stream of consciousness"" approach to technical authoring. This book is a breath of fresh air. As a novice with only a basic understanding of XML, I jumped right into the chapter on schemas and felt I had a very strong grasp of it in just an evening. Every topic was explained with clarity, and, yet it did not seem too slow or dull. The code samples included line-by-line explanations. If I got it just by looking at the sample, I could move on. Otherwise, the explanations were there to illuminate the sample for me. The review and exercises at the end of each chapter follow the collegiate textbook formula. Why is it a formula? Because it works! What a sense of accomplishment to get to the end and be able to answer the questions and perform the suggested exercises.

Expecting a fast paced and heavy techno sound such as from Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport, the album was very different. Sasha experiments with all sorts of sounds and many different tempos and emulates the sounds of heavy trance as well as slower paced techno beats like you would hear from the Crystal Method or Paul Oakefold's Ibiza. This album dips through the sounds of trance, pop, big beat, and even a slow trip-hop beat in Mr. Tiddles.

He starts with a magnificent intro song that completely brings you into the album from the start. He holds the bass that you are craving off for the first 2 songs, and it is well worth the wait.It's all so perfect in the way that he manages his sounds. Bringing you up with any one sound and holding it until you can't take it anymore, and then adding just at the right moment either a kickass breakbeat or another airy keyboard that is completely unique.

It is so oddly shaped that it is difficult to remove and impossible to replace on the unit without spilling some of the water.In addition, it seems like every cup of coffee tastes about the same.

"Her best record to date: Davis really shines here. Her first two records were commendable in their artistic integrity, production values and market risks, but this record really nails down what she does well: sings.The arrangements are stellar, and the layers and twists really showcase her composition skills. Her singing is rugged and compelling, and if the lyrical content is any indication, this is clearly her ""Sade"" record: somebody must have broken her heart and the listeners get to benefit from the raw emotion that shines through from her experiences. She channels all of her previous potential, influences and the freedom that running her own label affords, and comes out with a stellar record.

"'Natural Foods? Just another mainstream American Cookbook.: With the words 'natural foods' heading the title, I expected to find whole foods, vegetarian dishes, and low fat recipes. I did not. This cook book is exactly like every mainstream American cookbook I have encountered, it is full of meat recipes. Only 12 recipes made it into the vegetable section. In addition, there are ingredients called for such as 'canned mushrooms', 'packaged onion soup mix' and 'undiluted cream of mushroom soup'. One sauce recipe for a meat dish, called for a half pound of butter! I am not what I consider to be a health nut, but this book fell far short of my expectations.I could not find a publication date, so I am assuming that this book was written before there was clear health information on eating whole, low fat, foods.

A man who reacts rather than acts, through most of his life. It is also introspective of a man's view on loss. I truly felt this was a thinking feeling person's book.

"An excellent tale of the military, good and bad: I first read this book many years ago and have reread it several times since, through my time at West Point, in the infantry and special forces. Now that I am retired I can safely say the characters rnig true, to include the bad ones. I recommend a couple of other books about the military if you are interested: Andy McNabb's SAS books which are #1 bestsellers in England and an excellent view into special operations-- the SAS wasn't that much different than SF. Closer to home I've enjoyed Bob Mayer's Special Forces series-- wish they were all in print-- as I had wished for years they'd resissue this book-- but you can get some here at Amazon.

"Problem With These Discs: Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the ""menu"" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned ""off."" The only way to avoid this is to choose ""other"" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons.

"Very Good, But Not the ""Kick"" I'm Looking For: There's no doubt that Green Mountain's Dark Magic K-cups make extremely good cups of coffee. It's just that I don't think it packs that much of a punch. The finest espresso K-cup I've tried so far is GM's Espresso Blend. I like my extra dark coffee to have a little bitterness to it. That quality makes me know that it's strong, and Espresso Blend has it. Dark Magic is lacking that ""something extra."" I think the word ""sweet"" in the product description is the culprit here. Either way, I'd still recommend these to anybody, but Espresso Blend is the best espresso-like coffee to date.(Note: I have 3 varieties that I've never tried coming in the mail: Black Tiger, Double Black Diamond, and Revv. It's highly possible that one of those could unseat Espresso Blend. Can't wait to find out!)

The intriguing beginning piqued my interest, and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened.

It's a shame, because the book had so much potential. Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness. Her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better.

It may not have Michael Myers in it, but it still has that John Carpenter innovativness and plot making it a classic.

"Time to make corrections: Ok, lets get this right out in the open for some of the other reviewers that do not know what they are talking about. John Carpenter, had NOTHING to do with this movie.

Well, maybe the second one, it wasn't too bad.As for this movie, I'll be honest I've never even watched it. I guess I'll rent it someday and see what it's all about. At least it doesn't have Michael Myers in it, which is good, cause in my opinion he died after the second movie. I do think they should of changed the name of this though.

After all these years I wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film. Please note going into this film I knew Michael Myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that. Well - This film is terrible by any standard. I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow, horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense. The only question you will ask is ""how much longer is this movie"" after the first 1/2 hour.I love the idea behind doing something different with the movie besides Michael Myers but this one misses badly which is probably why it went back to the Michael Myers theme.

"Why?... Why?: How they could call this movie ""Haloween"" I don't know. I understand that was Carpenters Idea, but it was stupid. Micheal Myers is the coolest horror movie killer I can think of, and calling this a sequal to #1, and 2 is an insult to the movies. It wasn't even that scary, and the plot was horrible, even worst than Nightmare on Elm Street, and that is saying something. The only thing I can think of that is good is the director, but he made a terrible mistake with this movie. So I give it a 1 star. For that one factor. People may say this movie is okay and stuff. But a horror movie that has nothing to do with it's prequels, that's not scary almost at all, has a horrible plot, and is just plain stupid, is not worth calling what it is. Dont watch this movie. Maybe, maybe rent it just to see why it is such a bad movie, and then you can tell all your friends that you just saw a horrible movie. Well, that's all I have to say.

The information on how advanced and extensive some of the south American cultures were was good. However, I found myself getting a bit impatient with all the details about royal lineages, who killed who, etc. A bit more micro focus than I expected.

"A must for hard house fans: Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD 1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead.

One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem. Other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons, Van Loon gave us no insight of what Jesus Christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever. Could you give us a bit of depth? I don't get it.

"If you're having a hard time letting go, this is for you....: I love this guided meditation! When I fall for someone, I fall in love really hard and I can have a hard time moving on after a breakup, even though logically I know I should and I want to. This CD helps guide you through your feelings so you can release and move on. Every time I have used it I cry really hard, which is weird to me because I wouldn't expect to before the meditation. Releasing the sorrow is a big part of the healing process. I highly recommend it to anyone after a recent breakup or divorce; or anyone that is having a hard time letting go. This will speed the healing process so you can go out and enjoy life!

"Good Bike Rack: Bought this bike rack and it works perfect. Amazon was running it on a deal so I like that I got it for even cheaper than it was originally posted. My only complaint is that if your bike isn't shaped just so the bike sits a bit funny on the rack. It still works but you have to secure it from a bar that fits into the plate.

".A Call for Rationalism in Religion: The patriotic writer and essayist of the American and French Revolutions sets forth his beliefs on the place of religion in society. He affirms the need for rationalism in religion, attacks national religious institutions, and points out inconsistencies and fallacies of the Bible.

The copy said it was also for Photoshop users but it only covers through version 6 and the introduction says using applications other than Elements for the actions described may not work.I've not used Elements so I have no idea whether the book will be helpful there. It's certainly not helpful for me.I'm a professional using Photoshop CS and thought some of the tips might be worthwhile. I also use PaintShopPro 8.

Can't understand a single lyric from it (a few excepted) but it remains one of the best I own. It is soulful, enchanting, exciting, and mysterious all at once.If you are in the mood for something different that will grow on you, try this one. You won't regret it. I promise.For something similar and equally intoxicating, try Antonio Carlos Jobim's ""Wave"" or ""The Composer of Desafinado, Plays"". Both fantastic choices.

"The best book in the series: This was a awesome book, that focused a lot of it's attention on Dairine, Nita's annoying younger sister. Since I myself have an eleven year old brother who irritates me quite a lot (though I'll admit he's not as bad as Dairine) I found myself truly resenting Dairine's character in the other books. But, since this book told a lot of the story from her point of view, I began to dislike her less, and finally in the end I realized I identified with her quite a bit. This book was definitely the best in the series, both in character development and in writing quality. The Lone Power is such a cool foe! Kind of like the dark side of the Force except it's more solid than that. This book would be good for anyone who likes fantasy, and even those who don't might change their minds reading this books like these.

"Iagogo: As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous.

Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare.

"Fit my fuel pump canister exactly: The original Bosch fuel pump died in my 1991 Saturn after 20 years of service. a Replacement part was $600, for a 20 year old car. No thank YOU! I replaced it with a Walbro pump, bought on Amazon. Let's be honest, dropping the tank and replacing the pump is not a fun thing to do and you don't want to do it again any time soon. In installing the new pump in the old housing it makes no sense not to replace the strainer as well, the old one in my car was yellow, somewhat brittle after doing its job for 20 years. Some fuel pump makers will not warrant the replacement pump unless you replace this part as well- I can understand that as it is not hard to imagine pieces of a disintegrating strainer being sucked up and constricting the pump mechanism. Hey, if you are going to spend money on a pump, and the time to pull it spend the few extra bucks to do it right so that you don't have to do it again soon.

"Good Movie, but Best Picture of the Year?: This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year...

Ridley Scott evidently took the Braveheart forumla to heart, and his attempt to clone it is the flick Gladiator.I realize it's a matter of personal taste, but the choice of Crowe as the leading character is a poor one. There's always something filthy and unseemly that comes through Crowe. I can't put my finger on it, but it's a persistent problem with Crowe as far as I am concerned.Now back to Scott. His latest venture, Kingdom of Heaven, again follows the Braveheart formula, and exploits the hatred towards Islam in the West. An opportunist he is.

Also the writing is exceedingly dull, the story slogs along at an incredibly SLOW pace...Truthfully I found the story boring... but I read it anyway. I will not be reading the rest of the series.I think the writer's biggest mistake is trying to write the ""magic"" as if it were scientifically possible, and she spent way too much time trying to do so... Newsflash! Its MAGIC>>> you know fantasy, you don't need to make it or prove it... fantasy is simply a world that doesn't need explaining or proving.I think someone very young might like this book, but I did not. I am moving on to another series that has better writing.

"bla: I thought that this book was just kind of boring. The part with the white dwarf star that was hicoughing up all sorts of things was the only funny part, and the rest was just wierd and dumb.Contrary to one of the other reveiwers, the book was so much worse than Harry Potter.

"not so good: this book has a good title, it sounded great when I got it. The only thing is most of the plot is about how they got sucked into another world.

"It's no Harry Potter: If you're looking for something to hold you over until the next book in the Harry Potter series, don't look here. As a writer of fantasy, Diane Duane makes an excellent science fiction author. If you consider sentient marble-sized galaxies, ferocious living helicopters and predatory automobiles the staple for a book about magic and wizardry, then by all means get yourself a copy. Otherwise, check out some of the more traditional fare, like The Magician's Nephew (or the other books in The Chronicles of Narnia series) by C.S. Lewis, or two shining stars by Madeleine L'Engle: A Wrinkle in Time, and Many Waters.

"Romance and Laughs Abound!: I read this book in one day and enjoyed every minute of it. It has the classic ""Beauty and The Beast"" theme which happens to be a favorite of mine. Samantha was a spunky heroine who's quick wit and spunk made her the perfect match for her impatient patient. Gabriel was a hero to be adored. Unlike most ""wounded"" heroes who choose to sulk and mope about - Gabriel's defense was witty sarcasm and a beastly temper. He was a complete ass and I simply adored him!I found myself laughing out loud several times throughout the book and even came close to shedding a tear or two.Highly Recommended!

"Dear old Nolan!: Philip Nolan, a man who is sentenced to remain at sea for his entirelife, with the punishment to never hear nor see of the United States again. Hale captures patriotism and heroic efforts in one man as Nolan bravely tries to hide the fact he still loves his country, but shall never see it again. It makes you proud to be an American and live under the glory that our forefathers fought for. So many times have I read this story, and each time I can barely get past parts that bring a tear to my eye. Ultimately a great and powerful book for any reader who enjoys a story of love, agony, and pride.

"An Excellent Film Noir, Full of Suprises: ""The Proposal"" is an intelligent, first-rate undercover police story with a lot of twists and turns that you can never see coming. The Director has a real knack for building tension and suspense... it keeps increasing as the story progresses, and the mystery deepens as it unfolds. Jennifer Esposito really proves that she can play the leading role in a feature... she's radiant, and Nick Moran (from ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"") plays the nervous, paranoid undercover cop to perfection. Stephen Lang (Tombstone) is awesome as the subtly psychotic Crime lord, and it's nice to see William B. Davis (X-files' Smoking Man) play an FBI agent who DOESN'T smoke! Very clever, unpredictable, good looking film noir. Highly recommended.

"Joe Pickett? Must be the author himself.: As reviewer Joe Pickett said, this book is well-written and enjoyable. My personal preference is for single state travel books, because they are more exhaustive in their coverage, and thus more useful when traveling. The reason for this review is my amusement at finding an earlier review of this book from 2000 written by Joe Pickett. Joe Pickett is the name of the fictional hero of author C.J. Box's excellent mystery series set in Wyoming, and these books started appearing in 2001, after this review, with the award winning Open Season. I love these books, a perfect blend of mystery and western. So what say you, Mr. Box? Did you write the 2000 review for this book? I also can't help but wonder if C.J. Box is your real name. Perhaps you are a relative of Edgar Box, Gore Vidal's famous pseudonym.

"Not an Introductory Text: As an accompaniment to the program MacLogic for an upper level course I can see where this book would have a place. Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds. That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth. Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of ""v E"" (disjunction elimination). This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain.

"Not worth the money: I purchased this product because I was interested in a cooling fan setup for my 360. The SOLE reason I purchased this particular Cooling stand was because of the Green LED lights on the base of the stand. I just received the unit today and the lights, which I will reiterate are the only reason i bought this particular stand, DO NOT WORK. There was no mention of the lights not working in the description despite it being a used unit. It seems to me the seller left this out. Very unhappy with the fact that they seem to be broken.

"watch it!: brilliant... brilliant! one of, if not THE, best movie ever made, by one of, if not THE best director who ever lived. the photography is amazing, and includes tecniques that were never before seen on the big screen - such as filming from the hero/subject's point of view. the sharp cuts and strong colors that are used empathize the intensity of the film, and kubrick is constently mocking the viewers by playing with their feeling concerning the main character - Alex - who is at first the vilain and at the end the innocent, helpless victim used and abused by society. the cinical message that the movie tries to pass on is cristal clear and relevant to the time when it was published. it is also a message very much empathized by the book - which is by the way terrible and written with the skill of my three-year-old brother. kubrick generally critisizes the development of a cold, rottong society that won't possibly survive for long. in conclusion, the movie it the work of a true genius.

"""There Was Me"": Great movie! Stanley Kubrick is personaly my favorite director after watching this movie. After I read the book I went out and bought the movie without seeing it.

"simply a masterpiece: On so many different levels does this movie, based on the novel by Anthony Burgess, excell. Many will take one look at this film and abruptly deem it ""disgusting"" or ""sadistic."" But look closer, and you will find an incredible performance on multiple levels. From the cinematography, which makes you feel a as if you are a part of Alex (the lead character), and the soundtrack, which at first boggles your mind with the pieces selected, until your realize that there are none more fitting to accompany the story, to the obvious ideals and statements on society which Burgess realized and Kubric conveyed. In my mind, one of, if not the greatest books of all time transformed into one of, if not the greatest movies of all time. An all around masterpiece. A movie for which 5 stars simply does not do it justice.

"Passionate and moving: I am very impressed with this film. I am a Catholic and generally happy with that fact, but I am not stupid and the Catholic church certainly has done terrible wrong back then and even now. I had heard of Martin Luther and was curious to know more about him. What this film gives in incredible. I have never heard even The Pope talk like this. The pure unbridled faith of Luther is moving.The best part of this film is that it is not trying to preach. It doesn't say ""Believe this"" instead it presents the story without apologies and lets you decide what you think of Luther's views. The Church is portrayed as concerned for Christianity as a whole, but more importantly, overwhelmed with the furtherance of it's own power and crushing influence. I believe this is true even to this day.The world would be a better place if more people like Luther were in it. This will go in ""Best of the Best"" in my collection.

While relatively ballanced, one must still keep the presuppositions of those who created it in mind when viewing the historical material.The producers could have expounded on some additional elements in the time period that were directly related that might have helped a bit more in keeping the bias level less apparent, but the film definitely falls way short of being the 'Protestant Propoganda' some critics have labeled it.While not your Saturday Night Date flic, it is most assuredly a well done film and worth watching.

"Pandering to ""new"" fans.: I made the mistake of buying this album having not heard any of the songs, and only being a faithful fan of Kiss. Yeah I think that new fans (people that started to listen to Kiss after the reunion) might enjoy this. It has all of the elements of classic Kiss, but it's missing something.Do I think that the prime motivation for this was the money?Yes. Purely for cash. It's nice that the fans had something to go with the tour that was happening at the time, but this album doesn't age very well, mainly because this album wasn't very good in it's conception, and was executed poorly.In retrospect, Kiss has made worse albums. ""Unmasked"" comes to mind. Peter Criss' solo album was weak, but at least an effort was made. ""Animalize"" was poor, but Kiss was playing catch-up, and was breaking in a new guitarist too.Some of the tunes are catchy enough, but that wears off quickly. Based on the merit of the somewhat catchy songs, I rated this 2 stars. Other than that, not much here.

"¡Tengo un alma caribeña!: Even if you've never been to Caribbean, Gloria takes you there with this CD. Perhaps the majority of the songs are on the slower side, but she is ""soulful"" and it shows. My friend bought this CD, and I borrowed it so much that I got it for myself. The ""No me dejes"" remix will get you dancing. ""Tres Gotas de Agua Bendita"" is really fun and lively (with Celia Cruz), while ""Por un Beso"" is a heartbreaker. Yet even in the slower songs, the background music stays true to the Caribbean, which I appreciated. ¡Dale! You won't regret the purchase.

"Hummm... Not too much: I found this album a little dissapointing. And the sensation increase in comparation with ""mi tierra"". The main thing on this is the track selection, wich makes the whole a very downtempo album. Althought there's a couple of up & high beat pieces, the sensation I percive it's like if there were a down for gloria and she wanted to put it in the album. That's no bad. The bad thing comes up when I heard it and I can't get down, Just a little bored. There's no feeling, no emotion, no heart, no music. If you are planning to buy a gloria's CD, don't get this one. Mi tierra would do it best.

"Killer of SSX!!!!!!! :(: Every other SSX game was amazing. This one was very disappointing. I was at a store and I was thrilled to see it on the shelf. I spent (wasted) 40 dollars on this and started playing the second I got home. The music was horrible. The graphics were good. I hated the gameplay.This is baisically the game. There's ""The tour"" and your trying to get in 1st place. You get a better rank every time you beat a challenge. Another thing I dont like about this game is that you make a guy but you cant be any of the classic characters. Well you can unlock them but thats only for 2 player. And whenn you race against them in 1 player they are completely different. Like for example You have to race against Nate ( From SSX 3) And instead of being like a normal guy he is like a hick or something.And the point is that if you like the SSX seiries dont get this game.

"Jared Taylor Has Exposed Left-Wing Racism: If America is ever going to find the truth behind the failed Liberal race-policies, then every American has a moral obligation to read Jared Taylor's ""Paved With Good Intentions."" Indeed, Mr. Taylor has shown his courage in writing such a book, and he should be applauded for his nobel work. No doubt, there will be those who will claim that Mr. Taylor is a racist. But, the true racists are those who are attacking Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor unflinchingly tells the truth about race and crime and how Black racism is proliferating in America. If we are ever going to heal the already damaged race-relations in America, then it is time for us to speak the unspoken truth. God Bless Jared Taylor.

"More on Marilyn...: The Song Continues is an updated version of Horne's earlier My Life. Much of the text is the same. Even so, we needed an update, didn't we? For having a kind of ""take no prisoners"" style, Horne is pretty generous with foes as well as friends. (She doesn't re-tell the Sills/Scala incident here.) There are some new pictures, which is wonderful. Even more wonderful, and almost worth the purchase price all on its own, is the bonus CD. There are 18 songs on the CD. While they don't come up in chronological order, they are generally arranged earlier to later; you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved. I'm glad I have both books.

"Love his other books, but...: It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular ""The Ten Minute Guitar Workout"", ""Basic Guitar Workout"", and ""Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar"". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other.

Despite the statements which I have claimed about the quality of the book ""Cheap"", I still believe it passes my test by a mile, and it's explanations are extraordinary, namely for beginners. You can't even start to anticipate how this book altered my math grade. Instead of arbitrarily electing some sequence for the formulae, he invents his own effective process.

While it's nice to hear some of the old standards again like ""One More Time"" and ""Hometown"", he also does Duke Ellington's ""Mood Indigo"", which sounds out of place and sung painfully. His version of Steely Dan's ""King Of The World"" sounds strained. He should have put in ""Any Major Dude"" which he did so much better at The Bottom Line a few months before this gig. His musicianship is still very good, but you're left asking what's the point of this record? We can only hope that we get more of his quality stuff in ""Night & Day II"" due this fall.

"Simplistic: I teach strategic management in the MBA program and do not recommend that this book be used. The cases are very dated and industry restructuring, as well as poor coverage of new technologies (such as the Internet), make this book tedious reading. Miller also fails to include several theories and frameworks (such as Porter's industry analysis) which gives spotty coverage to some areas. The international dimension is also very poor -- the assumption is that international environments are similar to domestic environments and a pursuit of profits (Miller's definition of success) is all that is needed in both for companies.

"Best American Literature: The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature.McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul. Her's is a story of human wants, desires, needs, loss and the true human condition. There are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as McCullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel, what we want. I loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. After discovering McCuller's work through this book I have continued to read other books such as Clock Without Hands and others. She has become among my favorite authors of all time.

I havent' read anything else by her, and I don't think I will, I have a feeling life doesn't get better in the works of Carson McCuller and that's too bad.The writing is much better than OK, but,this work is amateurish in structure. There is no impelling story of any kind, just a wearing down, gets to be boring, pastiche of miserable and semi-miserable characters going nowhere except into a future of deepening misery and despair.Yes there are pleanty of folks like that but nothing redeems them here.McCullers is a southern grotesque who lacks the vitality of Flannery O'Connor and the enduring humanity and brilliance of William Faulkner.

The only real weak spot for me is Murder 101, which sounds kind of like an afterthought compared to the fully wrought songs elsewhere. Sleepwalker is, of course, one of the strongest rock singles in some time, but what surprises me is that the sparkling I've Been Delivered has not broken through on radio yet.

"The opposite of ""Ten"": Pearl Jam have changed considerably since 1991's debut ""Ten"", and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early 90s. Lead single ""Nothing as it Seems"" makes up for it's lack of bite with the exploration of soundscapes born in the Mid West, while ""Light Years"" and ""Thin Air"" show a subtlety in the band's personality that went previously unexplored. My only gripes are with the absence of a real grabber like ""Jeremy"" or ""Rearviewmirror"", and the trowaway nature of ""Grievance"", but, hell, I'm only nitpicking. Lovely.

"Doing the Evolution: In some respects, I think Yield is a better album, but Binaural still suffices for greatness. Binuaral contains three songs that are not Pearl Jam caliber, though they sound to be at first--God's Dice, Sleight of Hand, and Long Road 2, Parting Ways. Thriteen songs in the album, minus 3, equal 10, all of which are songs that could be played over and over again--some may argue for God's Dice--and I'm not say that it is bad either. The strength of the album is its quirkiness, and the band being able to compose songs that have natural sound to them. I think that's been key to their success. Key words that loom in Binaural are quirkiness,as in Rival and Soon Forget, supressed rage, as heard in Greivance, and mind-playing guitars that seem to want to spin into something off of Vs. but instead retain driving composure as in Of the Girl, Insignificance. What can you say? Vedder and the boys just keeping doing it . . .

"Binaural My view: Binaural is a mix of the new sound of Pearl Jam with the drummer Matt Cameron. It's great to hear Eddie playing different instruments like the ukele. Somehow pj sounds traditional in this age of boy groups and pop music. In 1998 they released the album Yield. Songs like In Hiding, and Given To Fly were ballads that showed off the mild rocking side of pj. Now on Binaural, you have songs like Breakerfall and Light Years that have simmilar rocking styles. Nothing as it seems, gives off the a Pink Floyd sounding background guitar by Mcready. Overall after listening to the new album twice it has grown on me!

"Don't Treat Your Fans Like Criminals with Copy ""Protection"" Rootkits/Software: This Santana album has MediaMax copy protection software embedded in the CD. The problem with this CD is that the MediaMax program installs undisclosed--and in some cases, hidden--files on users' Windows computers, potentially exposing music fans to malicious attacks by third parties. The infected CDs also communicated back to the record company about customers' computer use without proper notification.This is unacceptable and it will make me think twice before buying another Santana album. Also, if the record company wishes to treat me like a criminal and take away the right to make a personal copy of music I purchase because of a few bad apples, then it should realize that it will lose its few remaining customers.Santana, please release this CD without these copy protection schemes and I will buy it.

"All Than He Isn't - Santana Sells Out: I rated this one quite generously. That one star was awarded just to Santana's name because this music almost makes me feel cheated.Santana, in my opinion, is one of the greatest gutarists of all time. Sure, there are the technical masters such as Malmsteen and Vai, but no one has the same feel as Carlos Santana. It's just a shame that he would take all of his talent and throw it away on garbage like this.If you actually like this music, then have fun, jump off a bridge. But if you agree that Santana is better than this, than check out anything else, the earlier the better, and definately go live.Overall, this album makes me wannt to throw up. Santana replaces all the beautiful spanish sound and soulfull chord progressions with pop garbage. Don't buy it.

"A Chemical Dependency Must Own: This small under-rated book is THE definitive book on virtually all drugs of abuse. It breaks down each of the drugs by category and by use, giving the properties of each and their derivation, and side effects including potential for addiction. Anyone interested in the chemical abuse field, or merely curious about some of the drugs they may be prescribed, will find this an exceptional buy.

"The Best Debut CD EVER!: This band is amazing. Like everybody else, the first song I ever heard was Absolutely (story of a girl), and I bought the CD because that song was great. But the rest of the CD is even better. ""If I Am,"" ""Sometimes,"" ""Crazy,"" and all the other songs on the CD are gorgeous. They shouldn't be compared to other five person bands like Matchbox 20 or Vertical Horizon because they blow the hell out of those bands. Nine Days are five truly gifted musicians who deserve to go platinum one million times over. Everyone should by this CD because I guarantee there is not one track on it that will disappoint you. Nine Days is a breath of fresh air in the music world and should not be missed. Buy this CD!

"Biased, but Mirrors U.S. Version: Purchased Book thinking it was the U.S. version of the book, but received the International version (""NOT to be used in the U.S."" according to the cover of the book). To date, the book mirrors the U.S. version exactly page for page, question for question. My only comment would be that the book is biased towards a U.S. view. I thought this was quite strange for an ""International"" management book and the ""International"" version no less. Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light. It was my assumption that a book dealing with International subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences.

"Where is Rod?: Where has Rod Stewart gone? This is so bad that I couldn't even finish listening to the CD. I am such a big Rod Stewart fan, but I think his glory days are over. I have had my fill of his remakes at this point. Don't waste your money on this one.

We heard the television promo with some of the song highlights and immediately went to Amazon and pre-ordered it. We take it with us on car trips and love to sing along. It is a peppy and a fun companion for the car. We would have given it 5 stars if it had ""Leave Virginia Alone"" on it. That was one of his biggest hits and one we also enjoy. If you like the songs on the album, by all means by it and forget about what the negative reviews say about Rod. It is a good album and he doesn't deserve the criticism.

"Rod adds nothing to these classic tunes: As someone else wrote in review, Rod sounds like he's singing to a karaoke track. The backing instrumental tracks in most cases, especially Have You Ever Seen The Rain sound like they were created by turning a tape recorder on and copying directly from the original song. Boring. Also on Day After Day, Rod's drummer uses identical fills at the identical spots Badfinger's drummer's played his. The album is very uninspired. However,it was clever of him to record It's A Heartache because most people compared Bonnie Tyler to Stewart when she released that tune yrs ago. This is the 1st Rod album I've bought since Sing It Again Rod and this is not even close to the quality of that release. As most people said, Rod has enough money. If he won't write or perform any new original material anymore, he should think about packing it in. He's had a nice run.

"A book to live by!: In my yoga classes, the instructor would read a passage before we began each practice - something to meditate on. But I only have class 2-3 times a week, so I found the book very easily on Amazon. It was way more inexpensive that I had imagined, so I ordered a 2nd one for a friend. I have only ready through day 13 on my new book, but I absolutley LOVE it! I really appreciate how it is broken down into short, but insightful, daily readings. I read a passage in the morning before I am even out of bed now, and have the day to soak it in, then read the same passage again before I go to sleep with a new perspective. I see myself reading this book over & over again for many years - a great book to really live the yoga lifestyle by.

"Yoga for thinkers: As one who has never attended a Yoga class, I am fascinated by this book because I feel as though I am doing Yoga as I sit and read and think, read and think. Yoga is so much more than being on a mat, although that experience is certainly most central to the discipline. What I am discovering is the meaning of the discipline. I am able to envision the physical movements as I sort out, mentally, the meaning of my imagined activity. Because Gates puts his readers through stages of using their minds, he also expects those readers to repeat those stages over and over. In repeating the exercises, readers bring new thoughts and experiences to the reading activity and each exposure is different from the last one. As such, the book is always new, exciting, provocative, mysterious, riveting.

"Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds: I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch.

I've always suspected that Scott McCloud was the real talent behind this group, and he's the only one who still sounds like he's holding up, the rest of them just fizzle. This impression was reinforced when I saw them peform at the Mercury Lounge on a trip to New York a few weeks ago. McCloud came through (barely), but the others acted half dead. Johnny Temple in particular seemed out of it. I was pretty close to the stage and he looked sort of tired and stressed, so maybe he was having an off night. I hope so. Otherwise it looks like this is going to be GVSB's last hurrah.

"Not funny. No real plot. Poor satire. Not well written: I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor, it has none. If the author was trying for a book like, ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"" or ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""Animal Farm"" or ""The Jungle"" he missed by a huge margin. Truly good satire tells a story, and makes a message. BearV. Shark does neither.The book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable. It reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient (was that the author's intent?) I did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner, but it just plods along and ends.None of the characters are in any way believable. None of the situations are engaging. None of the attempts at humor are funny. I was really, really disappointed. Did the other reviewers actually read this book?

"Nice toy, poor training device: The hardware itself is well-built. The display is high-contrast and easy to read, and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally. The problem is with the software.The biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on 16 (hard or soft), not 17, making the device useless for practicing Basic Strategy. There are a few other quirks with the software. A player's three or more card 21 wins instantly--no push against a dealer's 21. Also, the dealer doesn't expose his natural, allowing you to double-down or split against it and lose twice (but also allows you to surrender against it). You are only allowed to double-down on a 10 or ace, a rule seldom found in shoe games. An ace-9 combination shows up as ""10"", not ""20"", but settles the bet correctly if you stand. And due to screen size limitation, you must stand on any six card hand; fortunately, so must the dealer.All in all, a nice toy, but not a serious blackjack trainer.

Otherwise, it's a great little exercise medium for the price and I like it because it's small enough to put away anywhere.

"Can You Say - Stuffing The Ballot Box?!?: At the time of this writing, when I click on 'See all 91 reviews' ALL OF THE 5 STAR REVIEWS on the page (reviews 1-10) are written by a reviewer who has reviewed ONLY THIS BOOK! Since 7 of these 10 reviews ARE 5 star reviews I either have to conclude that this book is the most sensational book of the century and inspires people who have never written another review ever to sign up on Amazon to do just that for this book OR the ballot box is being stuffed here. Read the more measured reviews and the astute reader will be able to easily discern which of these two possibilities is true...I, personally, don't like it when the seller himself or reviewers associated with the seller do not identify themselves as such when reviewing a product!

Tengan cuidado con otro ejemplo de pseudo ciencia: Tony Buzán y sus mapas mentales. Todos estos ejemplos tiene como común denominador prometer hacerlo más inteligente de lo que es.

"Not bad: The technique of ""Image Streaming"" has shown promising results in certain cases. Much of the hype and propoganda, however, has been that the process can create a 20 point gain in IQ, relying on the 1989 study by Dr. Charle P. Reinert, the ""Reinert Study"". The following link will take you to the abstract -http://www.themindaccelerator.com/research/rp2.htmThe study, however, does not detail a 20 point gain in IQ through image streaming, unless I am reading the abstract wrong. It discusses a much lower gain, less than half the advertised 20 point gain in certain circumstances. As for the validity of the test, not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves. Unfortunately, this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons. It is unfortunate, because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques, such as the Sedona Method.

Him and my boyfriend have played numerous times since Christmas and they are both addicted to it. My boyfriend keeps begging me to play it with him when my son isn't around. The lasers are very strong and neither of them have complained about having any issue with it working.It also seems to be very fast play. I don't think it takes them more than 20 minutes to finish a game.And I love the fact that it isn't something that has to be plugged into a TV to play and it makes you think and strategize.

"One of the all-time best jazz singers: In the pantheon of jazz greats, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Nina Simone stands right up there alongside greats such as Billie Holliday. Her work even compares favorably with the instrumental giants like Coltrane or Davis; she's that good. This cd is my favorite from Simone's catalog, ""Love Me or Leave Me"" my favorite song. While less socially relevant than some of the other songs on this cd, it will leave YOU wanting to dance.However, ALL of the songs on this cd are great. Some make you want to boogie (yes, I said it), some make you angry, some make you want to cry, but regardless, it's hard not to be affected in some way by each of them. I'd also recommend Verve's ""Nina Sings Nina"" cd.

It would be a great DVD if they had the whole show, uninterrupted. Why not just put the interviews in a whole different section or disc.

Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there. As for the DVD release, it's such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. The Allman Brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?

"A Good Family Game: My eight year old son received this gift for Christmas this year and he, my husband, our six year old daughter and I all played it about five times so far. It's a nice game to play together for a variety of ages and doesn't get too competitive. It's a challenge to remember the titles of movies, characters, and even offers other challenges such as having to figure out the difference between two almost identical pictures, etc.There is even two ways to play the game, a short version and a longer regular version. You do need to be by a working TV and DVD player, but it is enjoyable and the children tend to get a kick out of seeing the video clues for many questions.I recommend this for a family or group of children old enough to work the remote of the family's DVD player.

I found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories.In the end, it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from Pelican in the first place.To be honest, even the Pelican foam is not as good as the foam I used to use in the UK to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases.

For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, werealso quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on.

As they get to know each other Carolyn & Sheik Tarik begin to fall in love. Of course there are misunderstandings but they work them out... until Carolyn learns that the wedding is arranged and against the sister's wishes. There are some good twists and turns throughout the story which keeps things interesting. I enjoyed reading this book and hope you will like it too. There is a sequel to this book on Carolyn's friend Anne called ""Taming the Sheik"" by Carol Grace. One of the sheik's cousins mentioned in this book is the hero in the sequel. Enjoy!

"Horrified: My husband got this as a hand me down and started reading it today. I glanced at the page he had open and am horrified at what I read. Page 8 in the grey box titled ""Age Differences"" and I quote ""For the first 6 months, infants do not feel love and affection. They are wholly dependent on their caretakers to have their needs met-that's all"". What old school garbage! As a mother of a 3 week old it's already obvious to me that my daughter feels love and affection.

"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES MADE: Please come out with a DVD version of this masterpiece as soon as possible. I saw this movie many years ago, and never thought I'd see it again. If it had not been for all your reviews, I would not have known it was this movie. Yes, this is the ultimate 'primitive' movie...definitely much better than 'Clan of the Cave Bears'. Here are the things you'll see : hairy cavemen, cannibals, neanderthals, sabre-tooth tigers, mammoths, pigmies, great landscapes and sceneries. The movie will humble you and make you think how precious the most basic necessities of life really is. You'll experience love, sex, tribal wars, sadness, humor. And for the last time, forget the historical experts that always claim some movie is bad because its historically inaccurate. I won't trade this movie for 99% of the Hollywood movies out there today!

"Charming, if dated: This is a truly charming book that will make you laugh, cry, and all that jazz. It is a bit better than the movie version, and light years above the stage version. The stories of a family living with an efficiancy expert is funny enough, the fact that there are 12 kids (well, actually 11 b/c one dies of diptheria when she is really young) makes it all the funnier. Unfortunatly, this book is rather dated as is apparent by he considerable racism. (The Parents perform a minstrel show for their children, anything taboo is deemed ""eskimo,"" the sterotypical portrayel of a chinease cook, etc.) Fortuately, this parts are easiyl skipped over, though they really should be cut.

"Dissapointing!: Having gone through the first 3 chapters of this book, I must say I am really dissapointed. The author is supposedly trying to avoid the mathematical rigor to the account of explaining things in a physical way. Well, he almost completely fails in that and, the worst, confuses the reader. For example, he devotes 15 pages to smoothly introduce the reader to the concept of a manifold, promising a more rigorous definition to be given later on. When the time comes, he uses two ""brand new"" concepts, namely Haussdorf space and countable base, for the meaning of which, the reader has to look up in other books!(however cited in bibliography) If one wants to understand what all these things (manifolds, diff. forms, Lie deriv, etc.) are about, the best thing to do is buy a mathematical book. After all, it is hardly possible to satisfactorily describe abstract mathematical concepts if you avoid using mathematical language! For the interested, I am NOT a mathematician.

"Too Much Like Work: If I want to read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century, then I read a cultural history of the United States in the nineteenth century. This boring, pretentious, rambling, self-involved, pontificating mess passes itself off as fiction, but it reads like one of those junior-high assignments where students are told to imagine themselves living in another time or place. How on earth it could have received a National Book Award is a mystery, even considering the spotty reputation of the award. One or two times I began to feel swept up in the narrative (I appreciated Bogdan's journal entries, his unrequited pining for lovely young boys), but quickly enough that narrative flow was dammed by another lengthy, boring letter or monologue. I would refer those who want to read a masterful book about an eastern European artist coming to America in the nineteenth century to read Josef Skvorecky's 'Dvorak in Love'. Now there's a book!

"A moving call to re-examine the Bible: When I ordered this book, I expected it to be a defense of the Protestant position of Sola Scriptura, but to my surprise it is instead aimed at correcting liberal Christian views of how we form relationships with God. The book opens with a story of a Christian woman who was waiting for God to tell her directly that she should make amends with her estranged parents, when a friend told her to open her Bible to Exodus 20:12 and read.The book proceeds in this direction emploring the reader to use his or her Bible as a means to form a personal relationship with God rather than expecting God to speak by direct revelation. It also briefly defends the authority of the Bible against such attacks as higher criticism and the Jesus Seminar.Despite the ""Why"" in the title, I would have to say that it is more pastoral than apologetic. Even so, I recommend it.

"It's OKAY: There's a lot of hype about this being classic literature, and one of the best genre books ever. I disagree. Although Ray Bradbury is a superb writer, this book seems to fall short. The writing is overly poetic, and the dialogue is clunky. If you read this you may find yourself re-reading sentences to figure out what the hell was being said. Although not from the book, there are many, too many, sentences like this:""Will ran, didn't run. Jumped, didn't jump. He stomped his feet on elephant shadows and cat whisker winds.""Again, this isn't an actual sentence from the book, but something similar to the type of writing.Buy it, read it, experience it.

"Something Wicked This Way Comes: Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes is a tour de force in the over-use of metaphor and simile to the point that the reader must strain to follow the actual plot without being led repeatedly astray. The author also misuses words intentionally, for effect it seems, but to no discernible advantage. However, there is genius in the creative imagination that went into the plot - no doubt grist for a successful movie - where of course the metaphors and similes fade away as the screen writers and director are forced to visually develop the plot for the viewers. In toto, an very unenjoyably read.

"Loved it!: Something Wicked This Way Comes was a very interesting read for me. I don't think I've ever read a book quite like this before (this is my first Bradbury novel).The novel itself it beautifully written--at times, almost magical. Bradbury's prose is more along the lines of poetry at many points. This is a positive and also a negative. On the positive side, I think it adds an eeriness to the story. On the negative side, if you aren't used to reading this style of storytelling, it could very well hinder the story and cause disinterest. At first, I was put off by the poetic style. However, the more I read the more I began to enjoy it.I love the ""evil carnival comes to town"" theme. I liked the main characters, two kids named Will and Jim. I loved the relationship Will has with his father.As much as I liked this book, I couldn't give it 5 stars. I thought the ending was a bit, well, cheesy (for lack of a better word). But, even with that it was a really good novel and I enjoyed it tremendously.

"Predictable, simplistic and boring: I found this book to be so predictable, the story line was too simple...there was no depth to the story or to the characters....and I had a hard time sticking with it. The whole story focuses on this woman's issues with her own father that she then transfers to the father of her student. How do they fall in love? I haven't a clue because there was absolutely no story there to give that scenario any meat or background. I'm just saying.....I see the author has other books...I hope they are better for the sake of those who buy them.

"a very delicate writing: A curiosity of between a fiction and a true story makes me read this book. I really like ""the Lover"", it's one of my favorite book to recommand others, even though I don't like much Duras.The writing is so short, like pieces of puzzle, there is no order to explain. Duras wrote what she felt, thought spontaneously in a paragragh after another. This book is descriptive and the flow of feelings is so delicate. Especially, the reflections about the life that Duras explained in this story, are truly profound and even sorrowful for me.There is no tension, no exposed conflict, the story moves so still like the calm ocean. The tranquility in rich thoughtful description, that's why I like this novel.

"hard to follow: I don't care for the author's abuse of the time line. Duras' character development is firm, but her flashbacks are ill timed and confusing. Duras' message of using the women's body as a form of control and yet making the main character seem separated from her body doesn't seem to really say anything.

"One dominant flavor that didn't work for me personally: I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise. The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat. I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that.

"Blown away!: I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Johnnie Lee and her dear friend Asia about 20 years ago. She told me she was a singer, but I never had the opportunity to hear her perform --- until now!! All I can say is WOW! I'm truly proud of her. This disc is nothing short of sensational. Rock, blues, jazz --- Johnnie Lee has all the bases covered, and with an incredible variety of texture and tone. There is real passion in every song, and some of these melodies had to have been very difficult to master. I'm so happy to have found, quite by accident, this incredible CD. I hope she reads this review, because I was so taken with her way back then that I wrote a character based on her into my novel, coincidentally published around the same time that this CD was issued.

When I got out I had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films.Magnificent interpretations, a solid script, a good direction and -in occasions- a splendid BGM is all you'll encounter in this film.

On the other hand, you've got the Taoist alien dispensing generic new-age advice (Starman). Trying to mix the two was a BIG mistake. This movie was way too long, way too slow, too self-involved and overall just dull. Kevin Spacey has done some fantastic work (Seven; American Beauty; Usual Suspects) but this is isn't it. Also, someone said the ending was ambiguous. Not true. Prot is Robert Porter.

"The First Iron lady?: This is an excellent book and a lively and interesting read. Anne Somerset gives an insight into all sides of the character of Elizabeth. Her moods and feelings, (she was renowned at the time for her short temper), both as a woman and a Queen.The glamour of the Tudor court and what it was like to be in or out of favour in a clique where a careless word could in some cases cost you your life.Elizabeth did not suffer fools gladly and the book examines her religious feelings, her sexuality and the way she dealt with conflicts both at home and abroad in what was essentially a man's world. Elizabeth was nobody's fool and although she would listen to her advisers, she had a mind of her own, shrewd and extremely intelligent, and was quite capable of using her authority as monarch to make important decisions for herself.The book is a delight for anyone with the slightest interest in history.

The peroxide isn't strong enough. The dentist uses over twice the strength of these. I don't care how many packages of these you use, it will not work.Also...The bottom strips are too small to cover your teeth and they float off in your saliva. You're basically ingesting peroxide from them. I don't know how safe that could be, but it's not very promising to me. The dentist will cost more, but it will be what you are really expecting.

"Beware of cost of updates - opnly one free update offered: I purhcased the nuvi 670 from Amazon several weeks ago and I was hapy with the unit until I checked to see if there were map updates avaialable from Garmin.

So I spent all this money on a International GPS unit only to end up with one map being out of date. When I received the unit it had a 2006 maps for Europe and 2008 maps fo North America. There were updated versions of both maps available, but I would have to pay for one of them - the cheap one costing close to $70USD.

This track is a B-side for a reason. Totally inferior to anything on the full length CD. No, it's not an electro house dance track like much of what you'll find on the full length. It's a short, sort of campy cabaret style track that uses what sounds like a real band, including acoustic drums, guitar, and even a horn section. If you simply MUST have everything Andy Bell sings, then you do get plenty of his vocal, but if you're really more just about his classic dance sound, then pass on it.

"The masterpiece of American song: Perhaps the best thing to say about this Songbook is what Ira Gershwin said after hearing it. "" I did not realize how good our songs( George and Ira Gershwin) were until I heard Ella sing them. In these Songbooks she is at her mature best. Her voice is smooth, elegant, clear , beautifully nuanced, rich in range, remarkable. It is sheer joy to listen to her in the very best of the songs. While many prefer the drive and rhythm of Ellington I myself prefer the more lyrical and slower swinging pieces. But what is important is that this is a great Masterpiece which presents the great works of the American Songook in the best way possible.One can listen to these songs again and again , and doing so brings only greater pleasure.

"Where struggle ends and grace begins: I first read this book when I had to write an existential paper for one of my counseling classes. It was difficult for me to understand at first, but I read it again, and it changed my life in ways. So many times, we look at God and box him/her into compartments. When we do this, we think we have a good handle on who and what God is. Then as time goes on, and we evolve, our thoughts on God no longer relate or apply to our lives. Through the struggle to know, seek and experience God, we many times are disappointed when God and ourselves do not connect. Paul Tillich tells us that through the struggle, we must have absolute faith, and the god who is really God appears in Grace.

"Piece of Crap: I bought this radio because my last one that I bought in 6 dollars from walmart was broken from its antena and now it could play channels but there was static most of the time. I was too excited about new radio . I got my radio yesterday and it was biggest disapointment for me. This radio had more static than the broken one I had. none of SW cannel is working they are there just for show. None of these channels is clear enough that you can understand something. I will suggest either get some radio that can only work with AM/FM but have clear sound or spend more money and get something that works

"It doesn't really do it: This work has much interesting information but I do not think it truly defines the 'Jewish Mind'. I have the sense that the Jewish Mind if we consider its creations from Biblical Time to now is simply too vast and varied for easy definition. I would too say that as Jews value the idea of Creation , their own Mind is in a constant process of Development and creation. Any summary then seems to be a simple reduction, and not true to the Reality.

"Details, Details, Details!!: I did not care for this book at all. It was all detail and description. The excitement of the book isn't until the very end and even that wasn't so great. The only part of the book I enjoyed was the subtle way that Marian had feelings for Shane because she was so fascinated by him. Otherwise I couldn't wait until it was over so I could write my paper and get it over with.

"A Decent, Well-Acted, 45-Minute Movie: I had seen this movie on TV way back in 1991 on a local PBS station. I hadn't seen it since then. So when I got this DVD recently, I was really looking forward to seeing it again. I remembered how well-acted this movie was.It is a very good movie. However, I noticed that some of the dialogue seemed a little ""forced"" in certain parts. You could tell that the actors were ""reading"" scripted lines. This only happened in a couple places. Other than that, all the other dialogue was rendered in a natural and effective way.This movie is quite sad, and the actors really bring that across. You can sense their pain and hurt as they work through the anguish of Andre's death.This is a very good movie (and very short). Well worth the investment!

"Good fun, though not the strongest in the series: More good fun from Chester Himes. On the plus side, he finally includes some entertaining sex. On the other hand, one of the main bad guys here (the ""Colonel"") is particularly flat and unbelievable. Also, as usual, the end is much less satisfying than the ride to get there.

"not worth the money: After reading the editors note on this book one is lead to believe that this book will give you information on 19-century photography. You are lead to believe that a wealth of information is on hand, but it is note. In fact very little is shown concerning photography, and almost nothing at all concerning the cameras. In short this book is trash, and not worth the money, or the paper it is printed on!

"Best film about art and the artist ever: I try to watch this movie once a year. It is a gorgeous, slow moving thing. The better part of the movie is taken up with the battle between Frehofer and the form he is trying to bring to life on the canvas, with Emmanuelle Beart as his model. He gives up... she gives up... but they plow on through. The story is unsullied by any erotic (or at least, overtly erotic) connection between the two. But there is none of the neurotic histrionics and unrequited sacrifices of the usual films about artist: there is just the hard, greuling, work of having a vision and getting it right.This is freely based on the story ""The Unknown Masterpiece"" by Balzac. If only more movies ""freely based"" on a story could be as fine as this one. Knowing the story, which is a short novella, may actually add to the appreciation of the film and the character of Frenhofer.

"Garrison Keillor . . . need anyone say more?: It's a full hour of A Prairie Home Companion, not just the best bits from various shows. The version of the small church's struggle to find a musical director seems different from the one I have on another CD, but it's all delightful. Great way to spend an hour while driving in the country. WARNING: do not attempt to operate vehicle in town or under complicated road conditions while listening to any PHC CD. These require some brainwork, and I've almost driven off the road laughing a couple of times.

"An Old Favorite: I fondly remember this book that I read as a child over fifty years ago. I was looking for a way to address issues about manners with my five year old grandson and rediscovered this book. He clearly got the messages Leaf imparted and thoroughly enjoyed it. The author did an excellent job of succicntly and imaginatively presenting the rules of getting along with others and the consequences of not doing so. The terminology and pictures Leaf used to describe poorly mannered children was indelibly printed in my mind and has lost none of its charm.

"HELP ME!: Oh my gosh. I f you are looking for an interesting book to read. Don't read Treasure Island. It is totally on a reading level for way older people. Not 7th graders. I had to read this book in class and it was so hard to understand that I gave up and fell asleep. Boring Book. I wouldn't even classify it as a classic. I would classify it as a good way to put yourself to sleep.

"Stevenson's Best!: This book is the best book i have ever read! i have already read this book 5 times and i will read it much more in my lifetime. Stevenson blends adventure and intrigue splendidly in this fast paced novel about a young boy who receives a treasure map from an old buccaneer, and his adventures afterward. Hawkins, the boy, meets up with salty pirates and finds good friends in the captain and doctor. i would reccomend that anyone who loves a good book and an exciting thrill should definately read this.

"A treasure: This is an authentic masterpiece by the author of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, which tells a story of pirates in search of a treasure hidden in an island. Dr Jekyll is very different, a strange, puzzling, mysterious, symbolic story. The characters in Treasure Island are unforgettable, Jim Hawkins, Dr Livesey, captain Smollet, John Silver, the man without a leg who disappears in Latin America and the pirate Flint, a character who is always present, but only through the dialogues. This is a classic, but a cult novel as well.

"Review of ""Treasure Island"": Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" is remarkably well written, containing fascinating bits of foreshadowing, a unique and captivating plot, and undying characters that will burn into your mind indefinitely.My personal favorite character is Long John Silver, who throughout the novel seems almost schitzofranic. His one side is well-mannered, charming and witty, while his other face is ruthless, sly and money-driven.In Part One, ""The Old Buccaneer"", the strange new pirate pays Jim Hawkins a gold piece daily ""to watch out for a one-legged man hobbling down the street."" This is truly good, almost humorous, foreshadowing.The ending is perfectly crafted by Stevenson; it closes with Jim Hawkins describing his predictions for the destinies of the pirates he has traveled with.Thank you, Robert Louis Stevenson, for contributing one of literatures' most amazing works.

"Treasure Island: I thought that ""Treasure Island"" was a very good, exciting book and it made me want to read. There were some parts that were not as interesting as others and they needed some excitment and at these parts I didnt think that I was going to like the book, but by the end I didnt want it to be over. I thought it was very exciting how they were on the island with all these pirates and how they were both going after the same thing, the treasue. Adding new characters and taking away some of the old ones,death, was also a part of how it made it interesting. over all it is a very good book and I advise people of all ages to read it
