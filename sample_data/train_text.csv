"don't waste your time or money!: This movie will give ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" a run for worst movie ever made. There is truly nothing redeeming about this. Please, take my word for it. I know how it feels to want something new from this great story, but this is NOT it.I would give you specifics but the fact is I would have to recount the entire movie. The acting is terrible, the cinematography would not pass a college course, and the interpretation of the original material is by far the worst.It took WEEKS for me to get through the whole film. I literally had to stop over and over because I just couldn't take it! When I eventually did finish I put the CD away and swore I would never inflict such pain on myself again. If I could give this no stars, I would.

"Just walk away: I expected this book to be more interesting. It was simple and ""cut to the chase"" but it did not give real insight. It was almost as if you could handle any type of person as long as you have common sense and the ability to ""just walk away"". ""Just walk away"" tends to be the theme for almost everytype of person/situation/personality that was listed in the book. I wouldnt have purchased if i knew it was going to be so vague. I would just glance through the book at the book store.

"Love mash: Mash is great but why is it a 1-4 Collectors Editions its nothing spealial its the same as just bye one then two and three and so on its a great show but its just silly to make a collectors editions when there is no diffrence. BUT STILL MASH ROCKS!

"Old Rehashed NFL Films Footage.: I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible.

"Runs a little larger: The slippers are wonderful, the leather is so soft and the cut if perfect and very comfortable at the time of dancing, but be aware that they run a little larger (half a size) so order them half a size smaller and it'll be perfect in every sense. It's a wonderful product!

"So Far So Good: I picked this up for 14.99 at a local store.Definately a must for PJ fans.Disc 2 is way better then disc one, I think it even sounds better.McCready solo's are a little hard to hear, which is unfortunate.Love how they went from thumbin' to betterman, I barely even noticed the transition.Haven't seen the special features yet but for the price its pretty much already worth it.Almost as good as being front row, especially with a big tv and a good sound system.

"latch doesn't hold well: I bought it at Walmart, exact same one, for $9.00. The latch hardly keeps the container closed. It is very loose and the container falls open when moved. I am returning it. I'm amazed at the price of this item here. Way too expensive for what you get.

"Want even more of a hassle to get what you paid for? iLok: Bought an iLok which was required to install some recording software. Endless hassles trying to add the product to iLok, as Windows 7 does not have active Xcontrol and iLok says ""active x did not initialize"" and suggests you upgrade youriLok software ""if you installed it before 2008""! Last time I checked, it's 2012,and I had just downloaded their software. Their ""support"" is 9-5, M-F. This technology and technology like it is just another impediment to doing the businessyou wanted to do, adding another layer of B.S. and hassle, and particularly withmusic recording software is anti-music and totally sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Excellent quality for a good price!: I have owned the SD-1600, SD-2700, SD-2710 and when I was looking for another one, the SD-2800 was first on my list. The ColorStream component output makes your component capable TV look amazing. I would suggest calibrating your TV using the Enhanced Black level setting that this unit (and all of the above) offer. I tried Samsung, Sony, Phillips and I selected and will continue to select Toshiba. The features and picture quality outstripped units that cost far more! It is a true value for the money. The only real difference in this model compared to the previous ones is the controls built into the front panel that allow you to do everything without the remote if you need to. I have loved all of the Toshiba units I have had. I think you will too!

"Disappointing....: With huge expectations, I purchased this CD and was dissapointed to find it bland and sorry. The only winner on the entire album is ""Stitches"", a soulful, strangely sexy and seductive number. The rest of the CD is too metalic, venturing into ""cheese goth"". Don't get me wrong, I respect Orgy and believe their hearts are in the right place, but comparing them to Depeche Mode or Nine Inch Nails? I'm sorry...maybe their next album will have the sexy venom of ""Stitches""

"So sad.: I usually love these books . . . this one just couldn'y hold my interest. The story went nowhere, the characters were flat, the love story pointless, and the environmentalism/social commentary was tedious. ""The Serpent's Shadow"" and ""The Fire Rose"" were much better books, and I almost wish I hadn't read this one because it makes me leery of reading anything newer by Lackey.

"Do Not Waste Your Money: Nice looking and cleans up well but...This oven takes forever to heat up, make toast, and after a dozen uses the timer knob broke off when barely tapped by the tea kettle. Very cheezy brittle plastic knob. Yes, you will get burned if you touch the outside of the oven so be careful. I put an oven thermometer in it and it only reached 325 degrees after 45 minutes.There's no taking it back at this point, but you should look at kitchenaide. My daughter has one and it's quick to heat up and toast.

"This liner may be slicing my inner tube: I installed the liner on both the front and back tire. Since I had a major flat on the rear tire before I installed the liner, I also replaced the inner tube with one prefilled with slime. 30 min into the initial brisk ride on city streets, the new inner tube burst. I replaced it with a 2nd slime inner tube - 10 days later, burst again. Kind of wondering if the liner is rubbing against the inner tube. I noticed a 1-2"" laceration along the tube slightly off center. I am now trying something else - buying a kevlar tire with a generic inner tube and did not install the liner on the rear tire - will see how this lives up. Bottom line, I suspect the liner causes the inner tube to slide around and eventually rub against the inner tube and cause it to tear.

"Come one, come all...: The first time I saw this movie was many many years back in the 5th grade. My friends and I were avid horror/sci-fi fans as well as comedy fans, and one weekend ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"" was one of our choices to rent. This movie satisfied every sort of wish and desire that we wanted in a movie: it was sick (blood suckers), comedic (a large man saying to a small klown ""What are you gonna do? Knock my block off?"" and the klown proceeds to do just that), and the cinematography was awful (which only adds to the loveliness of the movie). If you haven't seen this movie yet, put the Cheez-its down, and go rent it, or better yet, go buy it. If you've seen it and didn't like it...well, you've got problems. If you've seen it and love it, come on over, we're all packing under the big tent and we're gonna watch it until DVDs are out-dated.

"Dubious... Caveat Emptor, Sox fans.: The statistical side is nothing special, with info you could get from The Baseball Encyclopedia or a host of great (and thorough) websites. The most glaring red flag was its description of the '78 playoff game, in which the author claims Bucky Dent hit his homer tying the game at 3-3. Anyone with a modicum of baseball knowledge knows the Sox had a 2-0 lead at that point and Dent's homer put the Yanks ahead. If Mr. Gentile can't be bothered to research that correctly, then what else has he gotten wrong? Nope, avoid this and go read David Halberstam, Thomas Boswell or Roger Angell. In fact, read all of them and feed your soul.

"A Camp Classic for the Ages: John Travolta's Tony Manero struts from the Brooklyn disco to the Great White Way and becomes an opening-night sensation in this misbegotten sequel to ""Saturday Night Fever."" Written and directed by that paragon of dance cinema, Sylvester Stallone, ""Staying Alive"" (1983) exists in its own warped universe. You know things are wrong when the Bee Gees play second fiddle to Frank Stallone in the soundtrack department. Leaving no cliché unturned, Sly handles the backstage drama in predictable ""Rocky"" fashion. The climactic bump-and-grind production numbers look like MTV run amok. A well-lubricated Travolta gives it his best shot, but cannot overcome Stallone's ham-handed approach. Top acting honors belong to Steve Inwood as the dictatorial choreographer-director - in other words, a poor man's Bob Fosse. Come to think of it, you're better off watching ""All That Jazz.""

"Not impressed.: I would say that I am a Ben Stiller fan but I was not very impressed. The best thing about this movie was Robert Downey Jr., that was good acting and good make-up.

"Outstanding!!!!!: To say that the Master Handbook of Acoustics is an 'incredibly comprehensive work' it's like saying that the Beatles were 'some band from Liverpool'. Without a doubt, a must-have. Better than that, buy two and enlighten a friend! :-)Now really, this is the absolute definitive book on acoustics, covering topics ranging from sound propagation to room acoustics to absortion, diffusion, refraction, reflection, diffraction and everything else you can think of.

"Classick - Move along people, nothing to buy here: If you think ""they don't make 'em like they u-sta,"" you're right, no matter if they look like what they u-sta to look like or not. Don't be fooled because this thing reminds you of the iron your grandma had for 37 years. This one will barely last you that many days.Within weeks, I couldn't use the steam function because the resevoir cracked and any water added drained straight to the countertop.The other night, after owning this for short a couple of months, I noticed the status light flickering. Tonight, it just plain stopped working. I got a few more passes over the right leg of my slacks when I unplugged it, dropped it from about shoulder height on the back patio, and plugged it back in. I was treated to about 73 additional seconds of warming before it checked out for iron hell.Spend the extra coin. Get a better iron.

"Our Favorite Book: Are You My Mother? is the perfect beginner reader. The story is easy to follow and keeps the child engaged in reading. The vocabulary is repetitive and yet not boring.

It is a favorite in my house and a gift I give often. We love this book!!!

"Helped, But Wish They Soothed Longer: I used these back when I was nursing my daughter in 2010, and they really felt good but didn't stay hot or cold very long. They were great cold versus the gel packs because those, in my opinion, are too cold (kind of painfully cold)...but I wish on the hot 'setting' that they would stay hot longer. I think after about 3 minutes they felt room temp again - and you can only microwave them so much at once without burning your skin off or making the seeds inside burst. Overall, I liked them.

"Words can't describe it!: I bought four of McMurtry,s Lonesome Dove series books (Dead Man Walking, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove and, Streets of Laredo) after being delighted by the Lonesome Dove TV series. I always thought that a book was better than its corresponding movie, especially after producers and scriptwriters were finished doctoring things up. I bought this collection on that basis (Lonesome Dove)and was sorely disappointed. I can't imagine that the author received the Pulitzer prize for any of these stories. Each book was a little too raw for me and in each one, McMurtry seemed to be in search of a suitable ending; in short they were too long, inane and disjointed. Have you read any of Tony Hillerman or Zane Grey?

"Just another conspiracy theory to make it more confusing: To be honest, I am rather biased pertaining to this book. He made a few good points, I will definitely admit to that. But Stephen Jones has also slandered the name of someone I know with the bit of tabloid trash he had to throw in to make it more interesting. I know it's only a personal opinion, but such things should never be published about a living person without any basis of fact. It accomplishes nothing but the destruction of another life.

"Endless Opportunities: A great book for anyone who enjoyed A Brief History of Time, Dancing Wu Li Masters, and Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, in spite of not understanding much of any of them. An even better book for those who talk about those books without having read them.A book that makes people think is rare, and a book that gets them to try to think together is a gem. The magical way everyone identifies with Adams's cartoons works in this book to make everyone want to participate in the experiment. This book is like a great meal - one hundred times better if shared with your friends.

"Don't buy the Kindle Version, get the Paperback!: I purchased the kindle version and it was not worth my money. The problem is that the table of contents breaks down the introduction into sections such as ""author, place of writing, date, etc..."" but then the actually commentary is just one section titled ""commentary"". This means that on a kindle you have no way of navigating 90% of the book. You have to click through the 200 pages of commentary one page at a time until you find the particular scripture you are looking for. Purchase the paperback version so you can easily find what you need!

"One of the best french movies made!: I'm learning french so I figured ""Amelie"" would be a great movie to watch to improve my fluency. It did more than that, it also broadened my horizons as a writer. I didn't know anything so unique was possible. This is a masterpiece! Audrey Toutou's heartfelt performance as a lonely young woman proved that we'll be watching more of her in the next many years. Why did ""Amelie"" lose the Oscar for Best Foreign Film over the boring ""No Man's Land""? Nobody knows.

"My all time Favorite Movie: I watched this when i was little, and i am so glad to own it on dvd now. This movie is what inspired my lifelong habit of eating as much pizza as i can. When i was little everytime we ordered a pizza i would bring out this movie and stick it in the vcr. My parents, and grandparents never really complained, as the must have seen it hundreds of times already. But it never got old. This movie is everlasting, so what are you waiting for order a pizza and put on the movie. You wont be dissapointed.P.S. Beware people who dont like all those 80's & 90's words (Radical, Dude, Righteous etc..)Watch out because that is how they talk.P.S.S. This movie is also why my favorite color is green. I guess you can say this movie inspired a piece or two of my life. Pizza and green, and whatever else i might not realise.P.S.S.S.

"Disappointing: I have had my eye on this litter box for months. After reading so many positive reviews I finally decided to go for it. My cat seems to like it but she isn't really finicky about litter boxes. I don't like it nearly as much as she does, probably because her favorite place to pee is on the little shelf thing on the inside, above the grate. I discovered this when I rolled it to the side and a significant amount of urine dribbled out down the side of the box and onto the floor. I can't get her to stop peeing there so now I have an oddly shaped covered litter box without the extra functionality I paid for. I didn't really like the system to begin with either, but I didn't have a lot of time to perfect my rolling technique before my cat discovered her new favorite pee spot. As excited as I was about this product, I can't really recommend it. I'm glad it works so well for so many other people, but for me it was a waste.

"One of the better Case Files: Case Files can be hit or miss, depending both upon the clerkship for which they are written and the reader's preferred style of learning. Pediatrics is one of the clerkships for which Case Files is more suited. Unlike some others, pediatrics requires both a detailed knowledge of clinical topics, as well as solid memorization of things like vaccination schedules and developmental stages. I found that I relied on Case Files in pediatrics significantly more than in other clerkships because I could flag pages for quick reference or memorization when I had a free moment. Granted, this should not be your sole text for the clerkship and shelf exam, and you should be skeptical of anyone who tells you otherwise, but it's certainly worth picking up and carrying around for those brief moments of down time.

"Lasts for years: We've owned this Little Tikes microwave for so many years and it's still in our family room. My daughter loved it as a toddler all the way up through kindergarten, which was just last year. She was always throwing things in there to cook.

Very cute.The only problem is the door, which can be difficult for very young kids to open. It should have an easy to grasp handle, but it doesn't. The kids have to push the ""open"" button in but grasp the edges and pull at the same time. They eventually get it.

"Hard to get through: I began reading this book with high expectations, having seen so many great reviews on this site. The story begins well enough, and keeps the interest of the reader, but soon after it seems to become a lifeless excercise in how not to finish a story or keep the reader's attention. After a while, I didn't care what happened. I was bored. I've tried several times to finish the book, as I hate not finishing one after I begin it, but it's just plain hard! If you're looking for something to draw you in the way Mieville or Van derMeer can, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

"Not the best: This is an okay version of Pride and Prejudice, but not the most superior one. It strays from the book quite a bit (I don't recall Darcy jumping in swamps nor even fencing) The acting is bland exept for Julia Sawalha, who is most melodramatic and Jennifer Ehle's smirking gets old quickly. The scenery is beautiful, however and so are the costumes.The 1979 BBC version, with a screenplay by Fay Weldon, is a far superior version. The movie is bang on with the book and the acting is fantastic--the actress portraying Lydia is a little histrionic and melodramatic, but the rest are pure perfection.

"Good ... But ... Needs a Supplement: Spanish Verb Tenses is unquestionably good at presenting and explaining the proper context and sequence of verb tenses. Used only as a reference, this guide may be considered 'self-sufficient'.If your goal is conversational ability and eventual fluency however, you will never reach that goal with Spanish Verb Tenses alone.I have been using Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CDs and Text to actually learn how to speak the language. The text that comes with Behind the Wheel is surprisingly complete, and even includes large verb sections (complete with illustrations no less) that break down the verbs (conjugation in a way).The method used is non-grammatical so a grammar guide such asSpanish Verb Tenses is ideal for use in conjunction with Behind the Wheel Spanish.I am very satisfied with my progress in Spanish using these twoapproaches.

"far worse than the first, not as bad as the last: gone are the ballet / dance-like fight scenes, replaced with loud explosions and sophomoric dialog -'what do you want?' ""I want the same thing you want - everything."" An abrupt cliff hanger ending, continuity errors, and overly long and frankly dull fight sequences. The characters are more interested in hearing themselves talk than taking action - Morpheus becomes a bore, and Neo becomes Steve Reeves as Superman - only the music is different.You'll want to see this because the first movie was truly an act of genius, but the directors cut of this movie should be about 35 minutes long.

We loved his first two albums, ""Spirit of America"" and ""From My Heart"", and this compilation album of those great songs, is simply wonderful. Thank you Dan for giving us another special gift. We await your next album, with great anticipation!!

"A string of random nothingness: This was one of the worse books I have ever read. It was a string of unrelated events, far too many uninteresting character s, and no purpose or storyline.

"An Unpleasant Book: I found this book very unpleasant to read. The perspective of the book is naive and uneducated. They make ludicrous comparisons between the trials they face on their chosen path and the life and death suffering of others. They also glorify hunting for the sake of hunting. Instead of empathizing with the authors I felt bad for them and pitied them. I was glad when the book was finished.

"The Relatives Came: Those relatives just hugged for hours and hours. It takes 4 or 5 hugs to get from one room to another.They all slept on the floor. Also, the relatives, fixed all the things that were broken. They ate all the watermelons and strawberries. Then they had to leave. This is a good book for people who like trips.

"Not worth the $0.50 I spent on the used copy: I bought this book after seeing all of the great reviews only to have both of my children ask why they were being punished, as well as if I was playing a prank on them,because what I was reading was so ""stupid"" as they put it. I did get upset with them for saying it was stupid but I could hardly blame them, the poetry, the rhymes and even the premise were better suited as a vessel to collect my dog's feces. I wish I could leave 0 or negative stars. Save your money and buy your children a sponge bob coloring book, the plot will be deeper, trust me.

"JUNK: I have ordered several things from amazon and always pleased by my purchases but when this came in the mail OMG JUNK. I am not pleased with it and don't recommend this to ANYONE. I thought it would be cute to have near our kitchen window so that my kids could see the birds closer then it hanging in a tree but the stupid thing struggles to suction to the window and I had to use tape to help keep it closed up. Don't buy this, buy a tree hanging one instead.

"What a very disappointing product: I'm glad that I didn't spend much on this diffuser for my built-in flash for my D80. This product not only diffused the flash, but also eliminated its effectiveness overall. Rather than getting some sort've soft light effect with this diffuser, I ended up getting underexposed shots (even with the flash strength boosted up to 1.0+). Thanks to the mediocre results I got from this product, I managed to just stick with my SB-400 in conjunction with an omnibounce diffuser. The pictures advertising this product look better than the product that you actually get. What you get is a plasticky/flimsy piece of material with velcro stickers to help attach it to your camera. Very disappointing indeed.

"A celebration!: Komeda's ""What Makes It Go?"" is a pleasure. It truly is minty fresh. Space-age cheesey fresh pleasure. The lyrics are beautiful while confusing, and Lena's distinct voice makes the words even more intriguing. The bass lines and drum beats are funky, while the melodies catchy. Every song in ""What Makes It Go?"" contributes to build a spacy world of quirky bliss. Komeda's music is definately worth a few thounsand listens. Maybe more...

"Mislead while the calendar ticked off 6o days on Amazon: The Seller told my husband that we must have bought a defective unit and could we please just send back for testing. This took us out of Amazon's loop which was one mistake. Then, the delays to get it back to us just in time to clock out the 60 days when we could use Amazon's buyer protection.Apparently, my husband has now read more reviews to find many customers share the problem we had so that is why I titled ""mislead"".We returned the original item within a few weeks so should have had the new one in plenty of time to discover the problem was ongoing. However, multiple excuses and delays conveniently ticked the clock so we are stuck with this item.So, lesson learned, do not go outside of Amazon ever when buying on this site!

"Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Seasons 1-7: This is a review for the collection of the individual silver boxes.After hearing the horror stories stemming from the 20th anniversary collector's edition, I thought it would be best to order this set. The packaging may be bulky, but it as far superior to that of DS9, VGR and ENT (I ordered those off the official site, so they are legit copies. The packaging is as cheaply made as others have noted).The video quality is obviously not 1080p, but I didn't think it looked as dreadful as others have complained. In fact I thought it looked really good upscaled, especially for a TV show shot in the 80's. The effects shots usually dip in resolution as they were not committed to filmstock, but I didn't think they detracted from the experience.Until we see a digital remastering of the transfers, this collection will have to do.

"pitfall: This book is a pitfall, just like many others out there. The only reason I gave it one star is because perhaps it might be a good lesson, especially for people who like to think they are better than others, more spiritual and advanced.If you follow the teachings of this book you are going to be stuck with your 'clearing procedures' forever. You will also provide a good feeding ground for all kinds of non-physical entities feeding on your energy and using your physical body for their own agendas.Your ego is the best guidance and protection you are given in this reality, getting rid of it is opening yourself up to invasion.Think well about the whole ascension concept, what really happens to you when you ascend, where do you go?The best way for people to grow and learn is to trust their inner guidance. Go out in the nature, watch what's around you, use your senses and learn. Don't listen to 'big cats' trying to get your attention and distracting you.

"More money, less enjoyment: Like a lot of other reviewers, I find this series more irritating as it goes along. It gets really confusing - you read pages not having a clue who you're reading about until suddenly you remember, or you read something that rings a bell, and you have to go back and reread it.

"Very Witty and Entertaining!: I found Tom Stoppards'play to be a magnificent combination of wit, humor, and creativity. Stoppard takes you backstage to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are waiting to play their parts in the Hamlet production that is going on onstage. Their utter confusion about making decisions and frequent mentions of death make fun of thier basically inconsequntial parts in Shakespeares' Hamlet. Its length was very short, but there were always plenty of interesting allusions and thought-provoking lines. Overall, Stoppards' play was a witty twist on the orginal Hamlet and I would love to see the play in action.

"The path you choose will lead to your fate!!: This is such a unique and new approach to a game. From the time you are a child to adulthood you make your decision as to what type of person you want to be. Are you a fighter, magician, a thief? Do you want to be help people or destroy them? Do you want to marry a man or a woman? Tattoos, hairstyles, clothing, shoes, and weapons, you have a choice in everything, and is what makes it so universal. You reall feel like you can inject some of your own personality into the character, not just playing a character that has been pre-created to look and act a certain way. I can't wait to see what will be done in Fable 2. Hope they add even more options, like piercings and gender selection and even more of the good stuff they have already injected on this one.

"Advice Filtered Through One Man's Interpretations of God: The true subject of this book was sublety hidden in Amazon's upfront on-line information. The title and the first few pages of actual text suggest an objective treatment of child rearing when in fact this book is a Christian Religeous treatise. I consider myself a Christian, but when the author bases his opions soley on what God has told him, then one wonders what the author's true intent is. Is he giving advice or is he ministering? If you like to be preached to then buy this book, otherwise try to seek out something more objective.

"""The Old Man and The Sea"": While this book was well written as far Hemingway's style is concerned, I fail to comprehend the point of a man trying to catch a fish (which is what the book basically focus's on) If you are looking for an easy fast read, and enjoy the sport of fishing, I would then go on to say yes, read it if you like.

"Thr3e: This was my first Ted Dekker book. The story sounded interesting but I wasn't sure what to expect from a ""Christian"" suspense novel. It turned out out be pretty good. It has religious elements but they don't distract from the story (except perhaps from one somewhat cheesy scene towards the end), which is is interesting from start to througout. The back story, about Kevin's childhood and his family is revealed in small doses, avoiding lengthy flashback sequences. Although marketed as ""Christian"", ""Three"" is a psychological thriller that should appeal to the general market as well.

"Worthwhile but flawed: This book refreshingly relates the realities of teaching. Rather than offering a ""quick fix"" sappy story, as do so many stories of teaching, the book outlines McCourt's gradual metamorphosis into a good teacher. It was pretty tough going at the beginning, though. McCourt's derogatory view of women as nothing but sex objects was tiresome to endure as he told tales of his sexual escapades. His ""chip on the shoulder"" attitude to college professors - who work every bit as hard as he does - was offensive. His tales of his teaching at technical schools was a bit mystifying: did he ever actually teach anything, or simply read at his desk while they chatted? The book gets a lot better toward the end, as McCourt hits his stride in creative writing classes at an elite high school. Is the moral of his story that good teachers need good students?

"Not Like My Casablanca: I bought my 1st two fans- this one and a Casablanca. The Casablanca is impressive- it's silent- even on really fast speeds, and doesn't wobble or tilt at all. Installation with the casablanca was a breeze. This hunter was a headache for him to install (something to consider if you pay your handyman by the hour!) and the quality just isn't the same. It tilts- although just slightly, and shakes a little. It's enough that I'm slightly concerned with it's position above my bed. Most annoyingly, I can't turn the fan off or on without some real effort. The cord is 'dispensed' through a hole that's slightly off-center so I can't pull straight down. I have to pull at an angle and in order to do that, I have to stand on my bed. Even then it's not easy. I had thought hunter was the name to get- maybe others are better??

It's amazing that a label with so much money could have so little foresight and common sense. Aezra continuously backed up tour dates, the album recording dates, and then blacklisted this record when they realised that Idol records could release songs on itunes that Aezra had foolishly elected to put on the record even though idol still had the rights to them. It's a testament to how not to run a label; Chomsky sold almost 4,000 records on little Idol Records in Dallas but big bad Aezra couldn't even hit 400. Don't do it--buy the first two records but let this one die in peace. Aezra should get 5 to 15 in the state penn for what they did to Chomsky.

My concern started when the box arrived and I had no problem carrying it in.... seemed much too light. When I opened the box, I only took one pan out and knew it was NOT worth the money. The pots and pan are very light and made of a thin aluminum. The non-stick surface is very thin, so it will not take much to scratch the surface. I put it back in the box and returned it.I went to other stores to compare what is available and have decided it would be worth spending the extra $100 and get a hard-ionized set. Bottom line...... look somewhere else if your wanting a quality non-stick.

"A good faith story ... but not suspense: I picked up this book because it was marketed as a suspense book. I have no prior experience with Blackstock's writing. From this perspective, I was extremely disappointed. I didn't find the story line suspenseful in the least. In fact, it was syrupy and predictable. The good people do good things and get their rewards, the bad people do bad things and get their just desserts.As a book about faith in the face of adversity, it was pretty good. If I had been expecting a story about how Bible scripture can help us deal with seemingly overwhelming circumstances, I would have been very pleased with this story. I think the story would have been more interesting if some of the characters had been faced with true moral dilemmas, though, or if there were some elements of surprise or interesting plot twists.

Also be careful around moles -- it will nick them as well.The price can't be beat and the convenience is great. The Beaver Shaver is terrific too, but powering yourself with Corn Starch can be the extra step that prevents you from shaving every few days.A razor will still shave more closely... at the same time it will also leave more bumps and definitely more cuts!For $40 this is by far the easiest, quickest, most convenient personal shaver around.

"horrible: I bought the PS2 Stunman game and I hated it. The handling for the cars is horrible. Most of my energy was spent trying to get the car to do what I wanted it to. The game play was also very repetitive, and the voice-over told you what to do after you were half-way through the mark.I played the demo, and the only thing that was improved for the new version was the graphics. It still had the same gameplay issues. My friend tried playing the demo too and had the same complaints that I do. I would give this game two stars for a good concept, but I wanted to counter act the five star from the guy who posted song lyrics.

"Clean sound, but highs are overdone: I agree these are a bargain at $20. The bass is fairly impressive for only a 3"" subwoofer, especially when placed on the floor. The position of the woofer makes a big difference.I wish they'd tone down the treble output since there's no manual control. Extended listening can be fatiguing. The searing highs give great detail and stereo imaging, though. I can now hear quantization noise (crackling) in 8-bit WAV files that I couldn't hear with my previous speakers.

"Travel mug: If you order a different color your review doesn't transfer. I read about this in a magazine which rated it highly. It is handy, mine doesn't leak, it fits my hand; I bought 2 one for home and one for office. It is a real let down. It does not keep hot things hot; you cannot clean it easily. Even after washing till you're arms are tired you cannot get out all of the coffee residue which eventually shows up in a subsequent rinse as scum. The plastic cap tastes strongly of plastic when you put a hot liquid in the mug...it may be free of the chemicals we are concerned about ""Today"" but something makes it taste bad. I would not buy it again or recommend it to anyone I liked and, in good conscience, can't even put it in a gargae sale to get rid of it.

"Even Apple gives you more leniency with your ""purchase"": I've been looking forward to this game, but after finding out how locked down this game is, I will certainly pass. Game producers need to realize that DRM hurts sales worse than piracy. At least piracy spreads exposure and can encourage people to buy the game. DRM gives media a bad rap and will only result in a backlash such as this. Many times I'll play a game for a while then get bored, so I uninstall it to save disk space. Later on I'll have the urge to play it again and reinstall it. I've also needed to reinstall OSs several times. Having to call EA for permission to play my own game is outrageous, they're stooping to Microsoft levels here. Drop the DRM, and I will buy.

"The long awaited Joey Bishop biography.: If your a big fan of Joey Bishop you will devour this book. Michael Seth Starr does an outstanding job chronicling the life and career of this legendary entertainer. You will join Joey as he climbs the show biz ladder from small clubs in Philadelphia, to the Copacabana and the Sands, to movie sets, tv studios, and to Broadway. Frank Sinatra dubed him as the ""hub of the wheel"" performing with the Rat Pack. You will not be able to put this book down. ""Mouse in the Rat Pack:The Joey Bishop Story"" is a great read and a must have for his fans.

"A good purchase for any wii-player.: Let me first note that this charge station and its accompanying battery packs work very well. I charge my controllers at night and use them a lot throughout the day. To date, I've never had a controller under full bars, and I have played for more than 10 hrs between charges.The wrist-strap makes charging awkward, but that doesn't bother me. Removing any bulky casing for your controller is required too. A lot of people complain about these two things, but it's not a soul-devastating, mind-numbing problem. I don't even see it as a star-reducing problem. These are the only ""issues"" with the charger; overall, I quite like it.

"disappointed: this review concerns the dvd. i bought this for the dvd hoping that i would get a live RITM performance. unfortunately, there are only a few songs performed live. the rest are more like music videos shot inside a dark room with some lights. these videos are not performed live but instead just go along with the studio mix of the song. bleh. most everything that is so great about RITM is the experience of seeing them live with thousands of screaming fans. the few tracks that are actually done this way, are outstanding. i would love to know why their entire performance was not captured. check out the ULTRA music fest 2004 dvd and get most of the live material that is on this RITM release, and in addition you will get many other performance from the top djs in the scene.

"Perfect for the purpose: I bought two of these, one for my refrigerator and one for a separate chest freezer. The first thing I did was test them against each other at both refrigerator temperatures and freezer temperatures; they were in perfect agreement.A major plus feature is that the correct refrigerator and freezer temperature ranges are indicted right on the thermometers so you do not have memorize them. Easy to use, just read it and see if it's in the appropriate zone.There is really no way to 'mount' these easily as-is; however, they they do have nice closed metal loops -good - and if you use some ingenuity you can do it. I used plastic tie wraps though the small metal loops to then go though some slots I had in the freezer.These are perfect for the purpose and appear to be of a very high quality and repeatability. I can't grade the 'accuracy' because I do not have a calibrated standard, but I'd bet they are very close. Great for home use.

The Altogether will definitely be in my CD rotation for a while.From the perspective of Orbital's past works, I find this CD better than Middle of Knowhere and nearly on par (andsoon to supersede?)

For those ofyou who don't like Orbital (which I believe is an acquired taste), you may begin to change your mind after hearingwhat they've done on The Altogether.

It also made me happy that Star and Vee are a reflection of ""real"" black women. I hope to see a lot more from Smith-Levin

"This doll needs design work: Sorry--just don't think this doll is worth it. I bought this for my 4yr. old who wanted a doll for tub, feeding and potty. The doll must be positioned just right to do any of the functions and is, in general, awkward to use and clean. Since there are resevoirs in the doll you must clean it out after it has been in tub or pool. If the doll is for a younger child there is definitely maintenance required on the parents' part. Because of the functionality rules, I find myself feeding and changinging the doll more than my daughter. Yes, I like playing with my daughter but the idea with a doll is for the child to be the ""mommy""or ""daddy."" Maybe this is best for a child over 6 or 7?

"The worst Book ever: I have read many books in my long, tedious life, and I must state this is possibly the most boring of them all. I am now a old man, coming up to my 86th birthday. I have read up on many interesting topics on twentieth century history, mostly on wars like the Boer war, WW1 and WW2 which I participated in. I decided several months ago to read up on the UN, well seeing as I am confined to a wheelchair there are not many other activities to do except reading or watching television. By a cruel twist of fate I ended up reading Norrie MacQueen's UN peacekeeping book. The English is abominable and the book does not sustain the reader's interest throughout any of the less than mediocre chapters.

However, it did stop working for me at one point, but you can fix that by pressing the reset button which is underneath. Press and hold the reset button until the motor stops. I also discovered it is not a good idea to press the start button when the opener is not attached to a can.

It's also something that can be stored in a drawer rather than taking up space on top of the kitchen counter.

"Hard to take seriously: The CGI animation is smooth and some of the scenes are funny, but this movie derailed almost immediately from the start. It starts off cute, but this is not a movie for little kids! Aunt Fanny is a ridiculous character with too many butt jokes - I would have actually given the movie another star if not for Aunt Fanny. For a movie that centers entirely on robots without ANY flesh and blood characters, the amount of 'potty jokes' on here is astonishing. There's only a few funny scenes, like the one where Rodney and Fender are trying to get into the Bigweld Ball disguised as a visiting royal and his personal attendant.Madame Gasket seems to me like she would be an outmode because her character design was drastically different from her son's and she was very clunky.

At least one, one of the more clever designs, was previously published in the International Papar Airplane Book, which I feel is a much superior book. This book is more fitting for very young paper pilots with its simple designs and colorful tearouts.

"Classic!: Graham Greene is the master. The movie was good enough, but the story is even better. Thrillers of this depth and complexity are virtually non-existant anymore. It was great to revisit this classic. The narration by Martin Jarvis is professionally rendered with Mr. Jarvis never once sounding as if he's reading a script or trying to perform a one-act play. Instead, he sounds every bit the weary, cynical, but very proper British policeman recounting a strange but true tale in post-war Vienna. Few narrators are this good. He really enhanced an already-crackling story.

"Worthless - lots of false alarms: Bought this radar detector after my Bel radar detector bit the dust after 10 years. I've had this detector for about a month now and found it to be useless. Lots of false alarms on all bands, especially on K and Ka. I have yet to see a police car with radar after the alarms go off. I had to turn off the radar detector ""detector"" features (VG-2 and Spectre) as they would go off for no reason. An example: sitting in a driveway of a rural subdivision and the VG-2 alarm going off non-stop, and I live in a state (Wisconsin) that doesn't even use these types of detectors. Voice alert got annoying after awhile so I turned that off too. My old Bel detector was always on the mark with detecting police radar and rarely had false alarms. I would not recommend this product to anyone - waste of money.

They were the ones that added the ""Oogachaca"" to spice up the song, and really made it a hit in the mid-70s.

"Sound bytes for sale!: This ""audio book"" is in fact a poorly recorded collection of sayings and quips from self-described ""marketing gurus."" There's no real insight, no expertise other than the ability to add ""war"" and ""battle"" to an already tired marketing phrase. Getting my money back would be a start, but I'll never get my time back. I'd go so far as to say this is the worst attempt at marketing education I've ever seen.

"Don't expect much of Hitler: The only reason people will buy this book is because they hope for some personal insight into the mind of Hitler. Forget it, this is a numbingly boring book, an exercise in ego gratification for the author. She lived across the street from Hitler's Munich apartment, at 16 Prinzregentenplatz. She saw him at a distance a few times and then pads these pseudo-encounters to a ridiculous degree. I seriously wonder whether she actually saw Hitler at all, since her stories seem spurious in the extreme.The vast majority of the book has absolutely nothing to do with Hitler. She is packed off to Switzerland, immigrates to the USA, etc. ad nauseum. Who really cares? The book found a publisher because she claims to have met Hitler. At least, then, include some interesting stories about the man. There are none in this book. Extremely disappointing.

"Get this book for kids who love to read.: This book was really exciting. It's about a boy named ""Boy"" and when he loses a puppet that belongs to his master (a magician), he gets sent into the World of Story to find it. He runs into all kinds of famous characters from nursery rhymes and stories, and ends up finding the puppet, and a new name for himself. A heroic name. (I don't want to spoil the surprise). There were funny parts, serious parts, lots of action and I thought it was great. I think kids my age would love it (I'm 7-1/2). I read it very quickly; I finished it the day I got it!

"Just awful!: Could only watch the first few minutes before going into 8x fast forward and it still was moving too slow! This one looks like it targets an audience of about the 3rd to 5th grade level in Japan. Animation is very poor (very little movement, very choppy), the dialog is incredibly simple, the situations and story are very standard, and the dub is awful! Very young children may not know better and may enjoy it, but there are some deliberate overtones of sexuality and pre-pubescent female emfatuation that might make this not a dvd to recommend to parents. Enjoy Slayers for better execution of the magic and fantasy theme on an adult level or Escaflowne for serious entertainment for adults or teens.

"Loved and hated: Wow, blast to the past. Jon Feder in this movie reminds me a lot of one of my ex-colleagues (in a good way), which makes watching this quite strange. Napoleon's eccentricities are all so amazingly weird that by the time we get to the end we're really truly relived to see his transformation - and my jaw nearly dropped when I saw it achieved. Skits tied together don't always turn out well, but this little film sort of has what it takes to stretch out to full length. My own high school experience was more like Napoleon Dynamite than other films like American Pie (good grief). The internet romance between Kip and Lafawnduh is a bit unlikely, as is the weirdness of ""Uncle Rico"" being Napoleon's guardian (Jon Heder was 27 when Napoleon Dynamite was filmed) is a stretch, but it's all in good fun. Vote Pedro!

For most that might not be a problem, but I was wanting the blue barrel with RED monkeys to compliment the yellows walls and represent the three primary colors.

I keep reading hoping to get to the point... As a fan of her earlier writings and knowing that she is one of the greatest authors of our time, I trust there was a point somewhere...but I missed it. I felt as if I was reading for required academic purposes. I found no joy in the process. I needed an index to recall the various characters. I would argue that in order to understand and enjoy this book, you need at least a week to dedicate solely to reading this book.

"One to skip: Greg Banaszak certainly has the technically ability required of a classical saxophonist, but his interpretations are flat, emotionless, colorless, and ultimately boring. Especially disappointing is the Rachmaninoff, which Banaszak succeeds in completely butchering with his thin tone and painful vibrato. The Glazounov is acceptable, but still suffers from overdone vibrato. The first and third movements of the Ibert are okay, but the second movement, one of the most beautiful and lyric compositions in the saxophone repertoire, becomes a clumsy and boring jumble of drawn-out long notes. I would not recommend this album to anyone who is learning to play the pieces performed on this album (that was the reason for my purchase of the CD). There are many other recordings of these compositions which would be more useful to a saxophonist, and more enjoyable to the casual listener.

Now (only 15 days into the school year) the guitar is falling apart and is practically unusable. Now the company is telling me they don't want to work with me because there are absolutely no returns after 30 days. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GUITAR.

Moore seems lost in her role as the movie's makeshift heroine: a woman let into the Navy SEALS training program under shady conditions, makes it very far and yet seems surprised to learn there were politics (gasp!) behind it. Even the usually sharp Mortensen appears to have a very choppy performance, probably due to poor editing. His performance as the evil military guy, the Master Chief, is not as sincerely evil as it could be and is not a winner. Predictable, boring, and typical would be the only ways to describe this one.

"Liked the Agressive Gal!: If you skipped over the age related parts of the novel...its a very good book. But it does seem kind of creepy to have a 17 year old kid and a mid thirty year old man to have attraction. Of course I wouldn't have thought so much of it had Warren not taken such offense to it. There have been huge differences in ages in other novels that didn't bother me at all. I liked that Amy was aggressive...but when they kept mentioning her age...well then it transformed into childish antics. BUT like I said if you skip over the mentions of the age difference...I thought the book was excellent. I didn't even mind Warren's constantly bellowing having become aquainted with him in the Gentle Rogue novel. ALSO you must read Gentle Rogue and Tender Rebel first so that you catch up on their stories. This is a totally worth while read.

"Argument by Anecdote: This book will not change one person's mind. Sticking to anecdotes, eschewing statistics and analysis, Baum strives to create an atmosphere of sinister conspiracy. But the simple fact that political spinmasters were involved in creating and selling the drug prohibition policy does not hopelessly discredit it. After all, politicians had to sell the Civil Rights Act, the New Deal, involvement in WWII, emancipation of the slaves, and everything else the government's ever done.Like most people who'd be motivated to seek out a book on the War on Drugs, I am sympathetic to Baum's general idea-- the War on Drugs goes too far, and a little treatment would sure go nice with, or maybe even in place of, locking up tons of people, many of whom are black. But to those of you looking for a balanced, informative overview of the history of the drug war, keep moving. This ain't it.

"great design, poor construction: This is the second set of DJP shoes I have owned. I wore these rarely. After a about two years the sole split right from the bottom that touches the ground to the lining inside. You could actually see the liner from under the shoe. Both shoes broke this way, its the spot right after the ball of your foot that gets all the bending. I love the design, but I will never buy a DJP shoe ever again.

"THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL...: Joan Baez is sublime. A clear, true soprano melded with a rich vibrato, she makes music soar to new heights. Her sound is crystalline and pure, whether she is singing a traditional folk song, a ballad, or a song with a message. All of the songs on this album were obviously chosen with care, as there is not one bad song among them. Each makes its contribution towards making this CD an outstanding one. It even has a song that Ms. Baez sings beautifully in Spanish, doing credit to her Mexican heritage. Ms. Baez is a singer without compare. There has been no one like her before, and no one like her since. This is an outstanding CD, fully remastered and with three additional bonus tracks.

"Great video & sound. Phoned-in performances except WILCO.: Sorry to say that most of the prior reviews are spot-on. This will appeal to so many people with good music taste that clearly deserve something better for their money, even if it is a fundraiser. This is such an uninspired show. You'd think from the lineup (and the man being honored) that Wilco wouldn't have been the only ones to put some thought and practice into their tribute. Broken Arrow is a three-run homer. The rest are strike-outs and weak grounders. Most are borderline boring. Sorry, but Neil Young deserves a better tribute and you deserve more for your $20...

"Shallow: I couldn't imagine that Woody Allen is capable of producing such a piece of junk. The film is supposed to be a nostalgic tribute to the 20's and 30's of Paris of the XX century with it's famous artists, writers and film makers,but actually it is about nothing.The acting is terrible, especially by a silly and totally unfunny clown Owen Wilson.All the characters are like cartoon pictures.Carla Bruni as a museum guide is just an anecdote (was there not any proper actress who could act this role?).And what is the story about? For what purpose are there so many art celebs from the last century gathered? A very poor effort, Woody.

"Wish he would dropout of existence: Man, the only good thing this guy ever did was the beat for Talib Kweli's Just To Get By.I am so sick of what hip hop has become. I'm so sick of rich rappers constantly talking about ""street cred"" and ""representin' ma peoples"" when they are in fact wealthy business entrepeneurs who own clothing lines and massive mansions. I'm tired of the culture and the media that glorifies them. I'm tired of useless worthless rappers who come out and own the world's attention for 15 minutes before fading from view altogether only to be replaced by the next flavor of the month. Hip hop, like punk rock, used to be an urban art form, a music that was the voice of disaffected street youth. Since then, it has become anything but.""President Bush doesn't care about black people!"". I have a newsflash for you Kanye: BUSH DOESN'T CARE ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE!I'm sure you and Spike Lee could probably care less about the white people who were affected by the Katrina tragedy anyways.

"No desire to vist Ranier after this: After slogging through this overwritten and overwrought account of the author's obsession with Mr. Rainier, I lost what little interest I had in ever visiting the place. The mountain is painted as dreary and gray, with grimy little spots of human encroachment. The only moderately interesting part of the book are the chapters on the Himalayas and high altitude climbing, which, if Barcott stayed on point, would not even be in the book. No wonder his girlfriend got fed up with him; he is not just a bore, he is a bore with an ill-defined and pointless obsession.

"Real time saver: I used my Steamboy for the first time yesterday and was very pleased with the results. I had done quite of bit of research before the purchase so think that I made a good decision. I have dark colored tile floors and most cleaning products leave a dull looking floor. With just the steam the floors are shiny and clean. I liked it so much I just purchased one for a gift for my son. I gave it four stars because of the short cord. I usually use an extension cord on my vacuum so it really doesn't bother me. But it might for some people. I found it easy to use and a real time saver.

"Romance Junkies says...: Sarah at Romance Junkies says: ""Sandra Marton has another hit with THE SHEIKH'S CONVENIENT BRIDE. Each story in the O'Connell saga gets better and better and Megan and Qasim's love story is no different. The sparks leap off the page when these two characters are together and it is obvious that they feel more than desire for each other, though they are wary of admitting it. This is a powerful story that examines a woman's role in a country that believes women should be submissive, and though this isn't the main focus of the story by any means, it definitely is examined through Megan. Nevertheless, it is love that makes this story so great, and THE SHEIKH'S CONVENIENT BRIDE is a truly remarkable love story.""

"not dependable: I purchased the product in July. The light would flash and flicker for up to 5 minutes before it would come fully on. In order to check the bulb it requires removing 6 screws and the tube housing the bulb. The clips that normally secure this type of bulb are totally inadequate. The bulb is loose and floppy. It might be that the tube end is meant to help secure the bulb. I found it tedious and time consuming to reassemble the tube, it must be lined up just so. I spent 30 minutes or more on this. I do not expect the lamp to be dependable and would not recommend it.

"Overrated Pap?: I think so! A Beautiful Mind is ""Movie Of The Week"" material that at times seems to parody mental illness. It misses it's mark from start to finish. Russell Crowe's job wasn't Oscar worthy in my opinion. And this is quite possibly one of Ed Harris' worst on screen performances. He's such a great actor. How did he get talked into this role? Since I wasted my $...at the theater, I don't intend on wasting double that to own this disappointment. A big blemish on Ron Howard's otherwise notable directing career.

That's the only way to describe it. It's detailed and long, but it's held my interest through the first two books of the series (I'm reading the third right now, and it's just as good, or better than the first two). It's LBJ's biography, but this series is also the best primer I've ever seen on how the House of Representatives and Senate function.

I took the machine to a Brother certified service center. They advised they couldn't find anything wrong, except that it didn't work and could not help any further. They advised to return it to the manufacturer. When I called Brother, they advised my only alternative was to take it to another Factory Service Center. I did, same story. It appears that neither Brother or their Factory Service Centers care if their products stop working once the warranty runs out. That type of service I can do without. This one went into the trash, a $180 lesson in what brand NOT to buy. I don't yet know what my replacement will be but it will absolutely not be a Brother.

If there is no action in the movie, then there needs to be character development so that I will care when the characters start getting knocked off. No luck here.I hoped that the movie commentary from Hoffman and Jackson would at least be enlightening, but it was of little value as well.You would be better off renting ""Forbidden Planet"" - same premise, better movie.

"Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Review by Kelly BondCaption: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Rating: 4 starsI thought that the characters were interesting. I thought that Harry was the best because he played tricks. Harry kept getting away with everything even though his uncle treated him bad. The dwarf kept coming up in strange places and no one else saw him except for Harry. There was one part when Harry was at school. Harry and his friends were trying to get something upstairs. He was not allowed to go upstairs but he did it anyway by waiting until everyone else was asleep. He got caught but again got out of trouble. He is a good person to play sneaky tricks. Harry could also use his magic cape to get anywhere he wanted to go. I think other teenagers would like to hear or read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

"We love Miyazaki, but found Cagliostro wanting.: We are a family of four, and buy DVD's for all of us to watch. The two girls, ages 4 and 7, have loved many Miyazaki films. They often have a young girl as protaganist and they identify with the character. Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl, Castle in the Sky, and Nausicaa may be their favorites.Castle of Cagliostro has more of a prototype feeling. The animation is less detailed, and more common in style. The characters are always in action, and don't stop and have the heartfelt moments that some of the later films have.All in all it seems like what it is: an animated TV show made long. Even his early movies show signs of the greatness that would come later, but I don't think we'll watch it again.

"Well-picked introduction to mid-50s Monk: Concord's 10-track disc provides an introduction to Monk's mid-50s recordings for the Prestige and Riverside labels. Collected here are prime examples of Monk in mid-career as an iconoclastic pianist, writer of jazz standards, and a band leader who attracted spectacular players to his sessions. Among the notable compositions are ""Blue Monk,"" ""Ruby, My Dear"" and ""'Round Midnight,"" and the sessions are highlighted by the talents of Percy Heath, Art Blakey, Clark Terry, Sonny Rollins, Max Roach, Paul Chambers, John Coltrane, Coleman Hawkins, Roy Haynes and many more. This is neither a full-telling of Monk's career, which also included key recordings on Blue Note and Columbia, nor of his entire six year run on Prestige and Riverside (the original albums of which are mostly still in print); but for an introduction to Monk's music, this is a good place to start.

The player just spontaneously died (just sitting on a desk... it wasn't being jostled around while running or anything). To my horror, I've discovered problems with the Nomad II line are fairly common ... To top it off, the unit was past its short 90 day warranty, so there's a [monetary fee] (plus shipping) just to have Creative examine the player for repairs. After they assess the problem, they'll charge extra money for repairs. For all that time and money, you may as well just buy a new player from another company. Stay away from this product. It seems like a great deal, but they are manufactured cheaply and prone to break down. Creative itself doesn't even have enough faith in their own product to back it up with a better warranty.

Vocalist Anders Fridén still has a lot of staying power and guitarist Jesper Strömblad returns the solos and memorable riffs that were dreadfully missing from their last two cr a p-fests! This isn't In Flames' best though, that honour would have to go to ""Jester Race"" but still buy this album and witness the return of this classic Swedish group!

"Hunter Gatherer Society?: I thought that this book was going to be a critique of contemporary western culture, but, as it turns out, the author believes that we should all go back to the living conditions of a hunter-gatherer society. She goes to great lengths to show how such a society is much superior to ours and much healthier. Yet there is not an inkling of a suggestion of how we are going to do this, or how we can re-adapt into hunter-gatherers, or what we would do with our complex infrastructure, etc., etc.This reader, in particular, would much rather spend an afternoon at a good movie rather than digging for roots to feed my family.

"A Made in the USA pump to be proud of and less $$ than the big box plastic junk: Guys, this a made in America (KY) pump that is well made, heavy iron construciton, brass data tag, solid float switch and servicable. I have had the same pump in service for years now and still love it. Reliable and quiet. I purchased another one, (this review), and it is built just as well. This is a high quality pump and it cost less then the plastic junk at the two big box stores. Pay less for a well made pump made in America! Packaging is also very good, arrived in perfect condition.

"Not even as good as Anthony can be: I've been going through this phase of re-reading books that I first read when I was younger, and like many pre-teens I had been an avid reader of Piers Anthony. It's interesting that I find now what I also found true then-- namely, that the first Piers Anthony book in any given series is always the best, with the following books becoming increasingly sillier and sillier. The first book in the incarnations of immortality series had some clever and original ideas, but past that it lapsed into the besetting Anthony sins of pre-adolescent boy fantasy and deeply goofy plot.

Mr. Thomas has a German-sounding accent and constantly speaks over the students.Honestly, you are ready to explode. No one on these CDs speaks Italian with a native accent. The constant corrections of the students is annoying and not helpful at all.I am so glad I didn't purchase this program. What a WASTE of my time.

"Not very effective: If you want something that actually obscures information, don't bother with this. It basically cuts paper into 1/4 inch strips, and obviously that can easily be pieced back together. Go for a shredder that tears up the strips as it's cutting them.

"good product: This hair dryer was a full sized dryer that lived up to it's expectations. The folding handle was nice and the retractable cord retracted most of the way. This made it easier to pack and for the size it didn't weigh that much. I bought this to travel in Europe and it worked great. It only had one speed with the dual voltage but it dried very fast. I bought a universal diffuser from folica to go with it and it fit just fine! I have naturally curly hair so was worried about the one speed, but I dried frizz free, of course I use a gel & silk product. Also only dried my hair three fourths of the way, this is a necessity for anyone retaining their curls and remaining frizz free! Overall was very pleased with this product and will use it here at home as well as abroad.

"worked well... at first: I normally am a big fan of nikwax products, and the cleaner certainly did a great job of removing the stubborn salt stains that had accumulated on my nubuck shoes, but the waterproofer was a disappointment.

"Lasted less than 30 minutes with a Medium size strong chewer puppy!: Learned my lesson: not ALL Kong toys are made with the same quality/durability. The Kong extreme goodie bone and extreme ball are the only toys that have a chance with my strong chewer puppy. This is a hollow toy, not made for strong chewers. My 39 pound puggle puppy loved it and destroyed it imediatley; he broke into the side balls in less than 20 minutes. Less than 10 minutes later the squeaker and the middle of the toy were practically gone. Yellow fuzz all over the carpet,and a pile of gray rubbery chunks of the toy had to be removed from the dog because he was eating it. I am glad I always stay near the puppy for at least 1 hour after giving him a new toy...this toy could have been harmful. It felt just a little stronger than a regular tennis ball,. for double the price.

"God awful, NOT for fans of Douglas Adams!: This movie died at every possible opportunity. It starts off with dropping the biggest joke in Adams' career with Ford Prefect tricking the demolition crew into not tearing down Arthur's house. The original demonstrates political bureaucracy and irony, as well as human gullibility, whereas this movie, Ford just bribes the crew with a few beers then leaves with Arthur. The movie is NOTHING like the book, the TV series (Made into a movie, rather cheaply made but WELL done). Everything in this movie past the first three minutes is NOTHING like the original. I can see why they waited for Adams to die before releasing it in the theaters.This movie will make any more-than-casual fan of Adams vomit in disgust. Not even worth a free rental! You've been warned.

The characters were shallow and not fully fleshed out, the story was beyond depressing, and the scenes with Daisy and her lover were way too graphic. In fact, I found that part disgusting....and I am no prude, believe me.A better, deeper, and more realistic book about the same subject is ""Good Grief"" by Lolly Winston.I think Miller is a good writer, but she seems to gravitate toward writing stories that do not showcase her talent.

A word of wisdom to future movie makers: when you transfer a very darkly lit and photographed movie to DVD, please LIGHTEN it up some visually!

"caveat emptor: Occasionally, unique and edgy styles take us to a new understanding of literature and open doors to better ways of communicating feelings and ideas. Another Roadside Attraction isn't one of those efforts. ARA, in my opinion, is a silly, trivial, self-important joke. I bought the book at the recommendation of a fellow writer when I was looking for a book that combined 1st and 3rd person narration. If I could get a refund, I would. This book's one redeeming characteristic is that it is printed on recyclable paper. Fortunately, I bought the Kindle version, which means I don't have to make the physical effort of tossing in the bin.

"Good compilation album: I think S&M is a good live album. The album contained some of the best of Metallica: ""Battery"", ""One"", my personal favorite ""Master of Puppets"". But there are no songs from Kill 'Em All, which disappointed me. ""The Four Horsemen"" is I think one of the best Metallica songs, or even a concert favorite, ""Seek and Destroy"". ""Enter Sandman"" and ""Nothing Else Matters"" are good but overplayed. I think on some songs the symphony ruined, like the Lovecraftian ""The Thing That Should Not Be"". But for the most part S&M will satisfy most Metallica fans, just because well it's Metallica playing live. Metallica sounds better than ever before with James's singing and Kirk's awesome riffs. It sounds like Metallica is still going strong and will continue to do so for many years. Peace!

"DVD Widescreen Transfer Is Perfect: I must elaborate more on the reviewer who said that the transfer to DVD looked like it had been dragged through a vat of mud.

The initial story About the five friends is interesting but the description of the aliens being born out of people's butts is disgusting.

This was also the most profane of his books with the F word on at least every page and the S word almost as much. It has too many unnecessary characters that are described in detail and then killed off 5 pages later. It was gory, gross, laden with profanity and mental plot lines that didn't make sense. Of course I did finish it being such a fan of his but I would not recommend anybody to waste their time reading this 600+ page book.

"Just Okay: David Foster Wallace's short essays can be amusing at times, but the descriptions can get tedious (see 500 footnotes for examples) and he rarely seems to connect with the people he's describing.I haven't read the DFW novels, but for hilarious and cringe-inducing non-fiction commentary, Sedaris is THE master, with Dave Eggers, Sloane Crossley and others far ahead of DFW.Sorry, I wanted to like the book more, especially with his untimely death.

"I learned nothing: The author does a good job expressing her difficulty in being a Jew and a Buddhist, and then tries to squeeze in a few ideas that try to bring the two together. I have studied Judaism for many years and I can say that she doesn't really know much about Authentic Judaism all she knows is what a Jew is in the modern western world, but that is not true Judaism.True authentic Judaism doesn't have to be forced into symmetry with Buddhism, it is readily apparent how both traditions come from the same source and flow beautifully together. What is needed is for someone to explain what Judaism is.There is a wonderful book that just came out and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to find out about this subject. I promise you wont be disappointed.It is a conversation between a Torah Scholar (Akiva Tatz) and a Buddhist Jew (David Gottlieb) called ""Letters to a Buddhist Jew.""Enjoy!

"Corn Flakes with a Twist: I found this item while searching for Granola and Berries and looked forward to it's arrival. However, I was very disappointed with the abundance of corn flakes.

"The Cuisinart DLC-2009CHB 9-Cup Food Processor is a wonder!: I purchased the Cuisinart 9-Cup Food Processor because of the Cuisinart rating in the Country Cooking food show. There was an ad in the paper for this processor and Amazon.com beat the price.The processor is powerful and mixes doughs rapidly without slowing down. You have shredded carrots, sliced potatoes, cabbage for slaws in seconds.Clean up is easy and there aren't a lot of tiny places in which it is hard to get food out.The DVD that comes with the processor is fun to watch. It shows you how easy the unit is to use.I would highly recommend this food processor.

"Terrible.: There is no glossary in the back of the book, so if you need to look up a term or vocab word you are out of luck.Each chapter has a glossary at the end, but there's 14 chapters so if you need to look up a word, you are out of luck because it could be under any of the 14 chapters.There is also not nearly enough information in the book to even BEGIN to answer any of the questions, exercises, or problems. The book also contains absolutely no answers, so you have no idea where to even start. It is impossible to learn anything with this book. Big thumbs DOWN

"Couldn't finish this one.: Rarely do I not watch a movie to the end to at least give it a chance. This one was so bad I couldn't justify wasting my time. I did go to the scene selections and chose the final scene to see if maybe the end was okay. Not really. I am not sure what was in between, but I can't think of much that would interest me on this one. I guess I should have had an idea when I looked it up here on Amazon and see the lack of any description at all. I guess that's why I went ahead with this review. Maybe it will help someone who wonders about it too. I would venture a guess and say there is no description because there is not much to describe. Sometimes even the best ideas need work. Too bad this one was left ""in construction"".

"Michael Moore and America: Uncomfortable with his own title? Well, he should be. It discredits the work. Anyone who thinks Michael Moore hates America has got a serious neurons-missing problem. It is obvious that Michael Moore desperately loves America - but his America is a different one from the America of his critics. One can agree or disagree with him and still see that this is true. Come on, people! Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton disagreed deeply, probably more fundamentally than Michael Moore and Rush Limbaugh do. But are there grounds for saying that both did not love their country?

"U2 ""The Stories Behind the Songs"" ""Great Book"", ""Very Well Ilustrated""!!!!!!: This is a great book that explains the stories behind U2's songs, through the album ""Vertigo"". It explains that the late Joey Rammone, really liked the songs in the ""What you Can't take With YOU"" CD. Also in this cd, there are songs like ""In a Little While"", and ""Kite"", and it explains that these songs are about ""letting go"" of someone you love. Sometime during this period, Bono's daddy died, so you can really feel the emotion, U2 puts into these songs. Also, the song ""Stuck in a Moment, You Can't Get Out Off"", refers to the late, lead singer of INXS, Michael Hutchencel. It explains he got stuck in a moment he couldn't get out of, and he commited suicide. So, don't get Stuck in a Moment You Can't get out of. Also, it explains that a lot of U2's songs are related to the gospel message in the Bible. Anyway, this is a great book, for any U2 fan. Thanks

Other then that its a preety good cd and i really recommend you to buy it. People probably give this cd such bad reviews just cause there jealous of her, cuz shes preety, a good singer, and a great dancer. If people say that she cant sing, then how did she even get two cds released. THat has to show talent for singing. I mean she already sold like twenty million copies.

I've bought quite a few products trying to keep my dog's breath fresh, but nothing else is effective except these breath mints, so when the supply starts getting low, I order again. The best thing about this product is its healthy ingredients, containing no sugar or artificial sweetner. She loves them. I still brush her teeth nearly every day because I homecook her food, and dogs that don't eat dry kibble need regular toothbrushing. But the breath mints are good for between brushings.

"Why did I pay for this?: Five college students have rented a cabin in the middle of nowhere where they intend to have a week long party. However, something goes wrong when they are exposed to a flesh-eating virus that infects one of them and now threatens all of them. Cabin Fever begins with an interesting plot, but that is all that happens to the story as the audience can see a cascade of terrible storytelling. Even the occasional jokes do not provide a foundation that could save the film. Most of the time the audience will feel lost and wonder what purpose the characters have as the director jumps back and forth between scenes without aim. In the end, Cabin Fever offers a cinematic experience that causes an annoying itch in the mind, why did I pay for this.

"Beware if you want to sync with your PIM: This is a nice little phone with a good color screen but the IR port does not work with any device other than a computer running Windows XP or 2000. You cannot pass info from another phone or from a handheld device into the E105 thru the irda port. And you cannot sync your phone with Outlook or any other PIM you may use, you can only copy the information into Samsung's EasyGPRS program for downloading into your phone. And the last problem I have with it is that each number is a seperate entry. You cannot have more than one number associated with a person without creating a seperate entry for each number.Nice phone but the functionality is very old school. It would be nice if they could have a modern software package with the modern phone.

I thought euthanasia would be terribly interesting, and it was at first. I loved Jamie throughout he novel and the fact he loved enough to kill. Then, I just got frustrated by Cam's unfaithfulness and Allie's reaction to his deception.

"pass on this one: My children were so excited to receive a DVD player for the car...only to find out that it didn't work at all. When we took it out of the box, it seemed to work for the 2 minutes we had it plugged in...then, on the first ""road trip"", it wouldn't work at all. We had it plugged into the car and it would keep blinking that it was charging. Once it said it was full, we turned it on only to have it blink once and go black. It would then say it was charging again. At home, we charged it for 15 hours..it said it was full...turned it on and the same thing happened- the screen went white/then immediately black and turned off and began charging again. My husband looked and the av outlet is loose. if you squeeze in that area, it started working 1/3 of them time. Definitely not worth it. Toys R Us did take it back, but would NOT return the money- only gave in store credit!!! So we don't know what to do...we don't want another one of these!

"Oh Dear!: I grew up in England, hence I tend to feel more affinity with UK based films in general. However, that doesn't save this film from extreme mediocrity. Even the worst 'Tough LA cop fighting the drug cartel' film has more going for it than this.This film dissapoints in almost all areas. The plot is far fetched and weak. Half the film is set in the 1960s, the other half in the 1990s, and the two halves do not marry well together. The special effects are mediocre. The film even drags down two excellent performers (Sean Connery, Uma Thurmann)who are given so little latitude that they can do nothing to salvage the situation. Overall, the impression is of a very second rate James Bond type movie, with cliches galore.I'm sorry Amazon, this review isn't going to sell you many copies of this DVD. The only people who would find this very interesting are young producers finding out how not to make an action movie. For me, I'll open another beer and stick to those LA cops.

They make more and more and soon they will be making worse and worse games. Why not mix Resident Evil with Dora the Explorer? Or maybe Metal Gear and Barney.

"Ryan's Review: Football Nightmare is about a kid who drops a pass and he doesn't want to play anymore because of that incomplete pass. So everyone always nags him and begs him to play, and he almost loses a couple of friends. He always runs into his coach and his coach always asks him to play. No matter what anyone says, he still does not want to play. In my opinion, it is not good, and I don't recommend this to anybody. There was not enough football in it so if you are looking for a football book, this is not cool, sporty, fun, or good it's BAD--trust me you will not like it. Well, I read it because I thought it was mainly about football, but it wasn't.

"Life in Seventh Grade: Space Station Seventh Grade is about a boy's life in seventh grade. His name is Jason Herkimer, and hes got a REALLY WEIRD life. His stepdad is named Ham, and he gets really dramatic when Jason or whoever steals his lunch. His real dad wants to become a Jew but is failing miserably. He has a crush on a girl named Debbie Breen but why would she want him? Richie is his best friend, along with Peter Kim, the Korean; Calvin, the doctor; Dugan, the guy who shows up; and that's all. Jason is in the process of making a space station with all the essentials of a city. But, I really don't know why this book is called Space Station Seventh Grade when barely of it is about it. He has an annoying brother that steas his dinasaurs. This book has absolutely no story and is only about the events in this kid's life, but this book is hilarious. READ THIS BOOK.

"A Math Physics Gem!: I got this little (relative to other math physics treatises) book about eight (8) years ago. Some years later i took the course with Sadri Hassani himself, who also has an excellent book on math physics (excellent teacher, too, by the way). The latter is a more modern and exhaustive text. Menzel's presentation is more selective and classical.Very clear, succint, enjoyable, logically organized. Intense at places, but the subject itself is complex. Topics are what you'd expect from a book of that era (Part IV on relativity is amazingly well-presented). One of these books that partially explains the good, solid, grounded mathematical grasp of physicists of generations past.And talk about affordable. For the money, not bad company at all. A true gem. Highly recommended.

"Very, Very Noisy....Too irritating to want to exercise on the unit: I received it today and put it together myself and it's terrible. I didn't expect the world, but I did expect the noise level to not be as bad as it was. The grating noise it generates is because the belt (no matter how tight you make it) hangs just enough at the bottom to touch the 2 metal guides that keep the belt on track. The grating noise is so bad, I really have no intention of using the machine again and after putting it together I really don't have the strength to take it apart to return it. Bad buy.Update* I fixed the noise issue but the track jerks and you can't get a good walking pace because it slips and jerks as you walk on it. If I make it loose, it will move to the left or the right, If I tighten, the tread won't move..Update** I'm right now trying to figure out how to fit it into my small garbage can outside. What a waste of money....

"a fine band: Three years ago I saw The Clientele play in Boston. There was nothing going on and I was tired of seeing another garage rock band. I was only slightly familiar with them. I was asked to review their first album. I didn't really know if they were from England or Ohio. They seemed like something like The Beatles and The Byrds. The guitarist had a distinct style of playing that was unique. Songs like ""My Own Face Inside The Trees"" are wonderful. There is a bookish and a sonic ability that is quite charming. I was into Louis Philippe a few years ago too. He arranged some of this album. That guy was really into lush productions of the 1960s. Stuff like Joe Meek and the Mamas and the Papas. Cornelius also explored this music. The Clientele seems to have created another brilliant record, that is its own world, and doesn't really care was is in fashion. They are a cool band.

She didn't have impressive sound equipment, just a mic and a synthesizer.

"Great USB Hub AND a Great Price: I purchased this hub back in September. I plugged it in and I'm running two printers and my mouse off of it at the moment, I've had no problems. It doesn't take up too much room even with 7 ports.My only complaint isn't with Amazon, it's with D-Link. After I sent in the rebate info, I got a card from D-Link saying my request wasn't valid because I hadn't purchased it from the right store. But I called them, and in about 10 minutes I had the problem cleared up and had my rebate a week later. I HIGHLY recommend keeping copies of all the rebate info, just in case...

"Invigorating: This is a well-designed product producing invigorating results. The unique design mixes air into the shower water increasing the intensity of the shower. The adjustment knob allows the user to control flow from gentle to full force. The package includes the shower head, teflon tape and a washer (the washer was missing from my order but the manufacturer was quick to send me one) and installs in under five minutes.

"no freedom: I bought this mouse with the hopes of being free from the cord tether. While it does give some degree of freedom, I found that the mouse must remain within about 18"" of the receiver in order for it to work. Heck, my cord was longer than that! A waste of good money.

"Not Director's Cut on Blu-Ray DVD: I agree with the last reviewer. There's gonna be much controversy with this Blu-Ray release because the last release on standard DVD was so spectacular. The Blu-Ray release seems to only contain the 165 min. version as opposed to the 219 min. Director's Cut. It would make sense for Criterion to release both versions with all the extras since they normally contain all the bells and whistles.

"Fan of Michael Hawley: I read the first book by Michael Hawley after it was given to me by a friend. I enjoyed it so much I passed it on to a friend, who passed it on to another friend and so on. It has made the rounds of our neighborhood. I purchased the second book from Amazon and enjoyed it as much as the first. It is now making the rounds of my friends. We all wish Mr. Hawley would write more mysteries. He is a terrific writer and we loved his books. Write some more.

"Pretty much what you'd expect for $1: I'll be honest, they look pretty nice. This concludes the positive portion of this review.These glasses are about as sturdy as a paper hat. One of the lenses popped out as soon as I took it out of the box. I managed to get it back in, but it's an ongoing problem. Also, the spring hinges do more bad than good; they're too weak, and when you wear the glasses, you feel like they're going to fall off your face because they sit too loosely. No amount of bending and reshaping of the frames fixed this problem for me.The lenses are perhaps TOO dark. When I drove while wearing these glasses, I found myself unable to read my own speedometer, even when I set the numbers to light up.I'd pass on these glasses if you're going to use them for anything other than a Halloween costume.

"Push it back to 2025!!: I unfortunately caught this TV special when a friend was watching it and, I have to say, it's truly awful! I was offended by some of the subject matter but, most of all, I was offended by the horrible singing and dancing that took place! Obviously the distributor of this DVD realized this and it's now being delayed for another 30 years! Good riddance!!

"An awesome book!: Aserial killer is taking women he has met on a singles cruise and taking them to different places (places named in the song""You belong to me"")and killing them. Dr. Chandler talks about missing women on her radio show, when someone calls about a victim(Regina Clausen) of the killer, the doctor tries to find out who the killer might be. A really good book,Mary Higgins Clark is a great author, alot of twists and turns.

"Great Buy: Bought this tv after returning a Samsung HP-S4233. Even though I bought the Samsung after a price match I felt I paid too much. The Hitachi was more at the time but after a one day sale I got it for a great price. I had to make adjustments for the day and night mode but I am happy with the Hitachi. IMO the Samsung picture adjustments are much easier. the Hitachi in HD is great. SD is ok. I really like the swivel base and the connections are plentiful.

"It's just painful: When I used the machine on my thigh it felt like a million little pinchs. To understand the feeling grab a handful of your hair and start pulling side to side as fast as you can but, the machine is more painful. All the pain seemed to be near the skin. It's strange but, I didn't feel anything in the muscle. I used all the different modes but, even on the low setting there was just a painful pinching. On the arm or the leg just a pinching feeling is what you get.I wish I never used it

"Was a fun movie and the casting was great....!: Just to see Babs back in comedy was a great thing! I loved her in ""What's Up Doc"" and ""For Pete's Sake"" and am glad to see her back doing what she can do so well. Dustin Hoffman was a riot as well...he and De Niro were a scream together. The premise of getting the in-laws together is one that's been done a million times but this took it to the next level. Loved the scenery and the ""Greg Room""...dog in the toilet and all that. I do have to warn parents that the PG-13 rating should be explored first...although it wasn't THAT bad, the senior on senior sex (therapy) is a bit..ah, disturbing (even to older folk!). I'd recommend this movie just to see the 4 'parents' in action. Great stuff.

"This one is worth it!: This is my favorite Talking Heads album. The quirky lyrics hint at paranoia and fear of everyday things like ""Paper"" and ""Air"". Some of the background music really enhances the flavor of the music like in ""Electric Guitar"". The funky rhythm in ""Animals"" has made that track a personal favorite of mine. If you are a Talking Heads fan, this is a must. If you're just into music, this is still definitely worth a try.

"A good read for a good cause: I needed a book to read and happened to pick this up because of the cool cover. Once I looked it over I realized there were stories by Helen Fielding and Melissa Banks, other authors I have read and enjoyed. Further, due to having a lot going on right now and not being able to read as much as I'd like - I thought a book of short stories would be perfect. And it was! I could whip through a story when I had the time and if a couple weeks went by and I didn't pick the book up I didn't run the risk of falling out of step with a story. Most stories were funny, clever and intelligent reading. And I felt good that my proceeds went towards charity.

I definitely prefer Stuff, and the song Porno Mouth grabs me everytime I hear it. My husband loves female artists but I can't handle the whining that's so prevalent today, which makes Holly the perfect compromise. Deep, soulful lyrics and striking, wrenching music that keeps me listening over and over.

"An Epic Adventure: An epic masterpiece, Troy illustrates Homer's Illiad with huge battles, romantic side stories, and a pinch of humor in this dark tale. Special effects and chorography give the battles on the beaches of Troy a realistic feeling. The actors really show the pain they endure during the Trojan War, and the reviewer connects with each. Although the Trojans have taken Helen of Sparta, there really is no evil side in this war, just evil people. Eric Bana and Brad Pitt really portray their characters well, and Diane Kruger and Orlando Bloom show their excellent acting skills, although they are not the center of the movie. Troy can be compared to something as great as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, however Troy is much more condensed. This incredible film is worthy of any viewer's five star award.

"extremely dry: The book moves through so many people so quickly that it is difficult to follow what is being talked about. The names are unfamiliar, the places are unfamiliar; and the maps often don't name the areas being mentioned. The font is extremely small and eye strain is also a problem. This type of material is what makes history unpalatable. I have discovered since leaving school that history is fascinating, but one needs to be able to learn about the times, the people and the places. Just dates and events, with people never being fleshed out is extremely boring. I was very disappointed in these books.

"Tastes Great but Less Filling: First of all I love(d ?)Skillet. The composition and arrangement of the music is always first rate, and this continues on this album. The sound quality, energy and excitement in their albums is always high, and this continues on this album. Their lyrics are always uncompromising, unashamedly Christian, and not shy about using the name of Jesus, and this is absolutely missing on this album. Lyrically what you get is Christianity lite, and Christianity in disguise. Oh don't get me wrong there is Christianity on this album, you'll just have to look for it, where in their other albums it was in the open for all to see. Skillet used to be my favorite lyrical band, and they also stood out as Christian leaders. Now they wear ""The Exploited"" t-shirts, and hide their faith. Where is the lyrical courage and genius of ""I Can?"" Seems to me like they're taking over the world by assimilating to it.

I received the movie within two weeks of the date of ordering. I was surprised to see that the DVD cover was 90% in an Asian language. I was worried that the movie would be in another language other than English, but I was relieved to find that it was in English with subtitles that you could turn off. I do think that it should be clearly stated that this product was for the Asian market but it still could be viewed by someone who only understands English.

"Guilty Pleasure...: There are faults with the plot of this film. I remember thinking, ""OMG, this will be the male version of The Craft!"" The reality is its not that good but I still gave it 4 stars because I find it damn entertaining anytime you put that many attractive men in one movie. I bought it for my best friend and we regularly watch this movie for no good reason other than, as we call it, ""The pretty of it all.""I know its a bad film but I still like it, sue me. It is bad in a way I still find enjoyable and to be fair it wasn't billed as the greatest movie ever. Even The Craft was a surprise hit so my expectations for this film were not that high and it didn't disappoint.

"Not completely seamless, but more than workable.: I'd been hooking up my 360 with an ethernet cable to my PC for a while, which I'd set up to share its wireless connection -- can you believe someone sells instructions for doing that on eBay? Not exactly rocket science, people -- when Amazon pointed me to this item. It's been perfectly functional since I got it. The only hassle is:(1) I have to unplug the power cable when I want to turn it off, and(2) it only connects after I run the Test Connection utility after each power-up. (Settings panel > Network > Test XBox LIVE Connection) This may be because I've set my 360 with a static IP address locally, so I can forward the XBL ports to it on the router.But to get rid of the cable running down the hall to my PC, it's worth it.

"Serious Writing--Not Erotica: Mary Gaitskill understands compulsion well. She takes you along the fringe and down the dark alleys of sexual urgency without pandering or exploiting. These stories are not designed to titillate, although some of them may. There is nothing mechanical, cliched, or pornographic about them. They are stories about the desire for intimacy--or at least some sense of contact--and the difficulty of achieving it. Stories of passion mixed with cold calculation. Is this the ""other""? Or is this you and me? The harsh light of ""perverseness"" throws these issues into even sharper relief. A particulary fine example of this is the ironically titled story, ""A Romantic Weekend,"" which manages to be both sad and comical. Gaitskill takes a detached view of her characters, but is not pitiless. Her ability to sketch them so precisely presupposes a degree of affection, or acceptance.

The movie ended in the middle of the book leaving me to say, ""huh?"" when the credits started to role. The movie illiminated three major characters crucial to the plot and the charm of the book and altered one character so badly that the essence of his personality was completed misinterpreted. The pacing of this movie was slow, slow, slow. I suffered through it. Save your money! It's not even worth renting. What a shame that a beautifully written book did not translate to video. A great opportunity was missed! Save your time and money!

"They tried but failed: I loved the book this movie is based on. I thought it fit pretty well with the story. However, a couple major aspects made it painful to watch. The movie attempted realism but completely disregarded major things.All the women had shiny and freshly shaved legs. This was a large distraction from the period the directors were trying to create.Also, there was too much of a sense of the 20th century. The characters movement was at times very modern as was the quality of speech.The directors could have done a much better job with the period.

The cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water is just not nearly as good as the original. This Is The Night is annoying and uninspiring. If you're the type of person who'd buy Clay's used gum, then go ahead. For the casual fan, I can't recommend this CD.

"This video game is great: I have played NBA Street and NBA Street Volume 2, but NBA Street V3 has got to be the best one I've played. I played this one in Nintendo Gamecube, and the gamebreaker has been even better than the original gamebreakers. It would have been even better if there was a Three-Point Shootout along with the Dunk Contest. I give this game a 10 out of 10.

"No Sanctuary: ""No Sanctuary"" opens with a new opportunity for Bay Butler to start her life over after being wrongfully accused of murder and sent to prison. She's fiercly independent, which does not suit her mysterious benefactor, a wealthy matron with a hidden agenda. Toss in a cop who has always had his doubts of Bay's guilt, and you have a mystery on your hands. Who is responsible for Bay's being sent to prison? And, what do they want from her now?The book was okay, but I wasn't able to become attached to the characters.

"Great natural-looking mascara: Well, no mascara that I know of looks totally natural (except one by Shiseido that is no longer made, as far as I can tell). I've been iso a light-weight mascara in brown that has just enough umph to cover the powder that most shadows make on lashes. This one is the best I've found--after trying more expensive department and drugstore brands. I still would like to find one that deposits even less mascara-stuff on the brush, but it helps if I wipe the brush with a tissue before applying to lashes.I'm in my 50s, and most mascaras make me look worse instead of better. Somehow that mascara-y look is severe and accentuates wrinkles and aging, I think. I'm thankful I revisited this one, as I enjoyed it back in the 70s as well.

"Read a different Follett book: I wish I had read the reviews before reading this book, however it was a gift so I dove in. Follett is one of my favorite authors, but this book doesn't even seem to have been written by him. It reads like it was written for a cheeseball action movie. It would probably appeal to a high school level boy. Follett has written some fabulous books, too many to mention. Pick one of them and pass on this dog.

Yes introducing XAML from the first chapters IS important and also important are images and graphics on a book like that (not to make you understand the concepts, that's not the reason of course). In a later book of Petzold about 3d graphics he starts immediately with xaml.Difficult to follow with unneccesary hardships. Sorry, cause otherwise Petzold is a great author and teached many things regarding MS's product line.

"Brilliant--cutting-edge research and eloquent prose: This book is stunningly brilliant--it makes sense of all the new cutting-edge brain research, drawing on the author's many years as an investigative reporter. But it's also highly readable, utterly compelling, and wholly eloquent in tackling one of the taboo truths about mothers all over the world and especially in the developed West, where our to-do lists grow by the minute, our media tell us to count our blessings, and medical professionals often fail to address signs and symptoms of depression at an early stage. I am buying copies for everyone I know who is a mother, has a mother, or cares about mental health: In short, I want everyone to read this book! its message, ultimately, is rather hopeful and highlights the resilience and resourcefulness of mothers and children. I LOVED THIS BOOK.

"Beyond Disappointing -: I thought based on the author's credentials I would at least be somewhat impressed with her books. I guess after reading Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell, Charles Dickens, Charlotte Bronte etc...I had my standards WAY too high, but I was so blindsided by the pure lack of depth, again, based on the author's credentials Yale, Harvard...a stint in England researching this book I was expecting to be at least mildly impressed. If you are familiar with the character ""Patty Simcox"" from ""Grease"", if she wrote a book, I would imagine it would be comparable. The only thing missing here are the hearts above the ""i's"" and smiley faces for periods....middle school dialogue combined with the intrigue of a fifty year old Nancy Drew book....gah!!!

"Why bother?: Why bother to read a book when a review alone clearly indicates that the author didn't do their homework. For example, according to other reviews, this book describes SAS as one of the most spectacular companies. However, that is just the company's excellent PR at work. Obviously there was nothing resembling investigative journalism. To include SAS in this book when there is a wealth of unethical behavior, payoffs, etc. going on there is just lazy work by the authors and questions the entire book's credibility.

"great stuff: I've been using Neutrogena T-Gel for a few years now, and there's a reason why I keep coming back to the brown shampoo in the clear bottle with a lavender cap. It works, plain and simple. Other reviewers here complain about T-Gel's smell, but I actually prefer it to overly fruity or heavily-perfumed fragrances of other shampoos.I find this product to be particularly useful in the fall and winter months, as that is when it gets really cold outside and my skin dries up. This shampoo, if used as directed, will minimize the appearance of scalp flaking (unless you have a crazy serious skin condition.) But for the average person like me, this stuff works very well, and I don't even need to apply it every single day. I usually alternate between T-Gel and my regular shampoo, which really helps the bottle last a long time. I bought a 16oz bottle close to a year ago, and I've still got ~1/4 of the bottle left.

"best hair metal album: Appetite for destruction is very good for what it is, which is hair metal, although it is not as good as Def Leppard's Hysteria and Pyromania. These guys learned alot from bands like Ratt and POison, and they are definitely better. This alubm is not their best, tho. Use You Illusion I & II are much better than Appetite because by that time they were better musicians are played a better variety of music. Guns n Roses best songs were written by other people (Live and Let Die, Knockin' on Heaven's Door). The best song they wrote was November Rain but that sounds like Elton John anyway.As far as hairmetal goes, these guys were one of the best, but buy Use You Illusion I and II and Spagetti Incident before buying this album.

"Barely edible and way overpriced: I wanted to try this as an alternative to the typical ramen cup or bowl of noodles and was expecting a premium alternative looking at the price. I tried it and was not impressed at all. It's basically instead of a dry noodle product partially hydrated and instead of a powered sauce, the sauce is already hydrated. So it's a dry ramen type product at three times the price because it has most of the water in it still (I paid $3.00 for one bowl). I was expecting some meat or veggies in it like the hormel entrees do, but all this had was a few dehydrated veggies and spices and a small bag of seeds to sprinkle on. Not worth the expense to me, and it also did not taste very great to me. 1 star, overpriced for the taste.

I was around when they were in their 'pomp' and they were a laughing stock among most metal fans then.Anyone buying this hoping to hear proto-extreme metal will only find a group of hamfisted village idiots churning out puny, clichéd hard rock with comedy vocals, muddy production and playing that most teenagers could now better. Only their image got them any attention at the time.

"A rich story worthy of wide readership.: In a field of much-hyped and overhyped ""legal thrillers"", some of which are merely poor imitations of Grisham and Taylor Rosenberg plots, this book stands out for its uncannily interwoven depiction of the many characters involved in a criminal investigation, from the journalists who cover it, to the politicos whose weigh in their agenda interests, to the prosecutors and police officers, to the victim who turns out to be not quite what he seemed to be in life. The characters have rich emotional histories which come into play, and there is even a very touching romance subplot. A great read!

"Stupid Characters - very very unrealistic: How can anybody like a book where the first 190 pages are about the most inane misunderstandings. If anybody had acted normal then the misunderstanding after misunderstanding would have been cleared up in 10 pages. How can half a book be about the flirtation between the wedding consultant and the (supposed) fiance of the client? Because NOBODY ever uses the fiance's name??? How can you spend 190 pages saying ""YOUR FIANCE"" and ""MY FIANCE"" instead of ""NICK"". How could a woman be so stupid as to flirt with an engaged man without ever saying ""WHY ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH ME WHEN YOU ARE ENGAGED?""I did finish this book, but I had to leap 10 pages at a time for much of it to see if it was going to get less slapstick. It never did. I did find the Darla & fiance wedding at the end funny (in a 3 stooges type of way), but I immediately threw the book into the ""donate"" bag. This is not worth your time. I have no idea how it ended up with so many good reviews.

"A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE OPERATION............: Though at times, I thought it a little concise on some of the action. Still, one of the best books around on Just Cause,ESPECIALLY because the author goes into the background of the invasion in some detail, namely, the 2 coups against Noriega, and his political plotting / manuevering. This is the only book that I've found so far that gets into detail on the Giroldi coup in October, 1989. The combat scenes are well-written and detailed,though,again, I wish the author could have gotten into more detail on the fight for the Commandancia, and the 2 Ranger airdrops. The photos are mostly post-action, and were well selected. All in all, a great book to learn about this historic battle !!!!!

Can't resist trashing others - especially Scott Carpenter. Anyone who was willing to strap themselves into one of those early capsules that was then attached to one of those early rockets does not deserve such rancor. There were bound to be mistakes. Minimizing mistakes as well as learning from mistakes was top priority. Everyone involved seemed to recognize this. But, Chris Kraft just couldn't resist getting in the last negative word about Carpenter. If Chris Kraft was as important and as powerful as he said he was seems like he could have delayed Carpenter's turn until he deemed Carpenter ready. Just sayin

After that, it seemed as if the author was defending her right to socialize with the upper classes.While there were a few useful pointers, I think this is a book to borrow from the library rather than purchase. It's entertaining in some ways, but not a book I'd keep.For a tour of the class structure and what differentiates the upper classes, I far preferredU and Non-U Revisited, although some of it is very dated. Nevertheless, class is a fairly eternal concept. Trends come and go, but the essence of good taste remains the same.

"The Pinnacle of rock and roll biography: As a preface, I'm a fan of rock music and as Elvis was the personification of rock in the late fifities, I'm also a fan of his early pre-movie work. Taken together the two volumes are a masterwork of rock biography and should be the standard set for rock bios to come. This volume is a retelling of the long spiral down from his Army years to his last days. It's less sensational than the Goldman work of several years ago and more penetrating. Mr. Gurainick chronicles the change in his later years by showing how his changing attitudes affected his concert performances and set list. Some parts changed my views of the last years. Others confirmed some already held opinions Most importantly, when I finished the book, I had a sense of sadness at the waste of talent as poor judgments steer him from his 50's greatness to the mediocrity of his Hollywood and Vegas years. We really do see the ""Unmaking"" of the man portrayed in Last Train to Memphis.

Then the more i saw it, the better it got. i personally did not consider Edward Nortan one of the better actors of our time, but after this movie, he defenetly proves himself. This movie deals with one of the biggest problems of our era: racism. It shows the perspectives of both sides of the mirror. While watching the movie, you knew that what Derek Vinyard (Norton) was doing was wrong, but you understood his rage. I personally think this movie is more worthy than many other movies of the same year. Basicly, the moral of the story is ""Hate is Bad"" (Furlong)P.S Dont listen to what other say, the ending is the best ending ever directed

The back is flimsy and the tray doesn't come anywhere close to the baby. I also called the company to complain about the design. They offered to upgrade to their more expensive simplicity chair, which features the same design flaws. Evenflo is way off base with this one. However, I must say the company resolved my complaint with a different product. Maybe if enough people complain they will take it off the market and go back to the drawing board.

"Chickenfeed: I agree with a lot of these reviews in that this guy who never put on a uniform(To include all those rightwing talk show junkies)can sit back and give credit to the military and so phase it in such a way that you - the listener might be dumb enough to think that he, Sean Hannity ,had something to do with the victory in Iraq. With the Military we have in this country, a 5yr. old could of led it to victory over Iraq. He thinks that this is the greatest military conquest in History. I guess he never heard of Alexander the Great- A great Liberal...

"Preferably zero stars...: To add to the other review, from another person mulitply diagnosed (now up to Autism, Elective Mutism with Austistic Features (High-Functioning Autism didn't exist when I was a child), Asperger's and Nonverbal Learning Disorder.Hugging is, and was, more than punitive to me when I was a child, and even now, as an adult, can be painful.Physically painful. Skin-on-skin touch, with humans or any other creature, literally feels like it is scalding if I haven't braced myself in advance. (Mind you, I've found ways to cope with it as an adult, since I have the misfortune to not be an asexual type.)For a moment, imagine pouring boiling water over your autistic child. This is precisely what your ""affection"" might feel like to that child. For goodness' sake, if a child is rejecting touch, s/he may have a good reason! And enforcing your hugging is only going to make the child start to avoid you.

"Materials yes - Techniques not really: I wish I'd read the other reviews carefully before ordering this. I have The Practice of Tempera Painting by Thompson (which is very detailed on the technical aspects of tempera painting) and I was expecting something similar here. Unfortunately it is heavy on material info (mostly about the pigments used) but almost nothing usable about medieval painting techniques or methods.Since most of the pigments mentioned are extremely toxic it's doubtful the book would be of much use except as a source of historical information. I, for one, would never have these pigments (lead, arsenic, mercury, etc) in my studio in powdered form. Very dangerous stuff!

"Another View: Our deep sympathies to Barbara for the agony of her past. A couple observations:1. Acolholism is not a disease; it's a choice. 2. Here is a classic situation of one of the results of the welfare system which we have allowed to evolve around us. Her father was not held responsible for his behavior and is EXCUSED because of the ILLNESS which he is responsible for contracting because of his CHOICE. The spouce can get welfare help and the abusive one is gone somewhere and not held to the guilt of it.It would take a long time to get out of situations like this even if we started now.

"Bad set of bulbs: I've used these bulbs for years, buying them at Home Depot. However, with this batch we had 2 of the 5 bulbs that we bought burn out within the first 2 weeks after putting them in the lamp. It appears that the solder at the base of the bulb ended up melting thereby causing the contacts to the filament to be lost. The supplier of these bulbs was not Amazon.com. Amazon.com did reimburse us back our purchase price.

"Tvaneste: I still don't know how to pronounce the bandname, but I can define their work; excellent! The guitar and drum work are excellent, the symphonic element adds grandeur and power, dominating and crushing weakness in today's black metal scene. The atheistic lyrics are intelligently written, but the extreme vocals are dry heaving, while still good, need work.The Intro and 'Under The Black Raven's Wings' track leads and violates, eventually leading into elevating madness. ""Birth of the Hero"" is an anthem to evil, ""Fire In Our Hearts"" and ""Godless Freedom"" are mesmerizing. ""Storm"" intrigues and opens eyes with psychotic themes, and ""Tears"" closes the opus with majesty and honor.This album is comparable in sound to Dimmu Borgir's ""Puritannical Euphoric Misanthropia"" and Arcturus' ""La Masquerade Infernale"", but with more captivating song structures and more operatic themes.An album for any avant-garde black metal fan! Brilliant from start to finish!

"Disappointing: If anything, my headaches and eye strain have been worse while wearing these. I was looking for some (relatively) affordable computer glasses with not-too-hideous frames (some of the ones out there are just awful) because I spend all day at work staring at the computer and it's taking its toll on my eyes, but now I wish I had sprung for the better quality glasses. The Gunnar ones seem to get good reviews, I'd suggest trying those instead.

"Hit Me with the Lead Wristband: You can think about this movie by just considering the slogan on the front of the box. ""One cage. One ball. No rules.""That one cage should be the one where the creator of this movie should be placed. He is certainly a menace to society and needs to be constrained. The rules of ""Cage Ball"" are incredibly dumb. People could easily score on every play but usually opt for the Mortal Kombat style sweep kick.The one ball is the one I'd rather be kicked in than watching this movie again.And there are certainly no rules invovled when the whole plot of the movie boils down to someone getting hit in the head with a lead wristband. Then lead wristbanders are accused of cheating, which would seem to be impossible under the no rules stipulation.They should add one rule to this movie, never watch it.

"Great for vocabulary building and pronunciation practice: Don't depend on this software to teach Bengali script or grammar. You should use it in conjunction with a grammar book. I use this and 101 Languages of the World mainly to practice pronunciation but also to build my vocabulary. You can click on a word over and over to hear the pronunciation. You can also record yourself and compare your pronunciation to that of the native speaker. The software focuses on basic vocabulary like numbers, colors, greetings, travel phrases, food, etc. It has games to reinforce learning.I like the fact that they show you each word written in Bengali script which helps with word recognition when I read Bengali. I highly recommend getting this and 101 Languages of the World. I am giving it 4 stars because they don't teach as many words as I would have liked. I estimate that there are about 400-500 words. But for the purposes of improving pronunciation it is worth it.

As we approach the end of my 15 year old lab's life I have once again pulled the book out to help me through this tough decision. I have also bought this book for MANY other people who have faced the death of their pet. I cannot tell you how much it helps.

"a un-abashed beautiful landscape of a masterpiece: The brothers have done it again. they have managed to out do themselves. this album soars through 11 tunes unique to the cehmicals. there aren't just the brilliant rave tunes ( under the influence, got glint?) but brilliant electronic-finished pop songs (out of control, let forever be). they even show thier dreamy, sweet side with the astonishingly beautiful Asleep From Day and Dream On. and the guest singers make it all the better. the best in the business lend a hand and make the album all the more enjoyable. their ability to still write great dance epics (the sunshine underground, hey boy hey girl) shines through more so on this album than before as the songs are more concentrated and less complicated. all the tracks go well together and they throughtly prove theat they are the best out there at making this unique blend of music.

"The Absolute Worst for Subscription Service!!: Playstation: The Official Magazine isn't a bad gaming magazine at all . . . the content is decent, and the reviews aren't bad either. It's just the service that sucks!!! I just got my renewal notice in the mail today, and over the course of my subscription thus far, I missed THREE (3)...count 'em...THREE magazines!! What can possibly account for this act of gross, heinous negligence? I'm certainly not the only customer to voice my concerns about this serious issue. You can read for yourself the other negative reviews on here.To be honest, this was my first magazine subscription that I've ever bought through Amazon, and it's definitely going to be the last.

"OK flashlight: Was slightly disappointed with this flashlight. It is a black and white camouflage LED that is plenty bright when it works. It may be just bad luck with the one we received, but when the battery cover is fully tightened, it doesn't function. Have to unscrew it slightly and then it works well. Otherwise it is the perfect size and weight especially for kids to use. Just frustrates them a bit if it isn't working because the cover was bumped too tight and needs adjusting.

"WOW!!!: This video has 2 major segments. You'll start with a short 14 minute progressive interval step sequence which is very easy to follow (although you may need to slow it down if you are a beginner). It starts gently and then increases in intensity through about a 4 minute peak of lunges, then cooldown slightly and start 4 minutes of arm weights. This progression then repeats (with different moves) for the second major segment. Then there is a series of 100 sit ups (20 of each type) and then a few moves to work on your back. Then there's a stretch.This is a great workout! I have never been so sweaty and felt so good in my life!I would recommend this video to anyone who is in decent cardiovascular health who wants to work out to their maximum capacity.

This album is awesome, I don't know wheather to say that it's better or worse than Millenium because I love them both, but I think I like this one more. ""As long as you love me,"" and ""Quit playing games with my heart"" are nice and romantic, while ""Everybody,"" (a personal favorite) and ""Hey Mr. DJ"" are sexy and fun to dance to. This is a great debut album,They harmonize so well, and they do not lip-sync, they are truely real performers! If you like any of their songs you have to buy this album! The only one thing that is better than this album, is seeing them perform live! But since we can't all do that 24/7, this album is a must buy!

"Spam software: This is a spam software. It's good for the people that Amazon carries this, so that they can read the reviews before they fall in the same trick. However, Amazon will get sued one day or another because of selling spam. The software itself is cheap, but all the cost to have a professional come out and fix customer's computer is not. Be aware!When it installs the 'ringtone maker', it also installs its 'MAGIX manager' secretly. There's no easy to to quit from the 'manager'. You can't uninstall from the control panel either, because it stays in the system all the time. When you close the 'Magix manger' windows, it pops up another window, which does not even have a 'close' or 'quit' button.1 Star is the lowest possible here, I wish I could do negative.

"Very cool jams.: This album kind of walks the line between metal, stoner rock, and the BLS type driving rock, with a hint of nu-metal sprinkled in. It isnt the greatest album of all time, but the riffs in particular kkep you interested as they drive you forward to the next verse. The lyrics are cool, although at times, a bit, i dont know....unimaginative. One particular example of this is Mothra. The lyrics are cool, but the part where he is actually saying Mothra....i like things to be a bit less obvious i guess. However, that being said, the album, including the lyrics is, as i said before, very cool, and will keep you interested throughout. A nice find from, after a little investigation, a band with quite a bit of inner turmoil. This is the only release under the name Atomship, though you will find further efforts from these guys in Papercut Massacre, Watership Down, and i think one or two other name changes throughout their history.Enjoy!

This book sounded interesting, but 98% of it was scrabblegrams (I must've missed where it said that). I like puzzle books with different games, not just the same ones over and over. It has a few word searches but they're so simple.. no brain work in it at all. And the mistakes!! In a word search, an entire line was missing! And in a bunch of scrabblegrams, the bottom line circles were either in the wrong place, or not there at all. Just a lot of careless errors. I wouldn't recommend it.

"best rap album ever?: Before i heard this album '2001' by Dr Dre was my favourite rap album. After continualy listening to this album for the past 4 months (since I bought it) I have found my new favourite album - and it just happens to be a hip-hop album. Talib and HI-Tek are certainly helping to bring rap into the main stream. If you love Hip-Hop you'll love this (forgive the cliche but here it is true)

"Not helpful in anyway!: This book was such a bad introduction to Wicca that I would never recommend it to anyone. What little bit there was on Wiccan practices and beliefs could be found in any other introductory book on Wicca but with better detail.Penczack should have called this his autobiography because all he talked about was himself and his own personal experiences with his mother, his sexuallity, and his finding the Wiccan faith. It is not helpful for other young men, not even other gay men. The chapter on divine mothers/sons is just an excuse for him to talk about his mommy and has almost nothing to do with Wiccan beliefs.I am glad that I had read two other (and much better) intoductiary books on Wicca before I read this one otherwise I would never have been interested in going farther in the Craft. I admit I only got halfway through this book before I stopped reading it, because it was just aweful. And I have seen Penczack on TV and he is a pompus ass who really likes to milk his publicity!

"Unexpected Brilliance: This was an unexpectedly entertaining read. I got a stack of old Laymon books for my birthday, Flesh included. I thought by the synopsis that it sounded a little hokey, but it would probably be a half decent light horror read if nothing else.It turned out to be really engaging, well beyond what I thought it would be capable of. I hate to say I had never even heard of Laymon before this, but I'm certainly glad i got the pleasure of discovering him for myself. It was extremelywell-written, descriptive and entertaining. Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.If you're a fan of this - Come Out Tonight by Laymon is another good place to find some entertainment.

"Good Concept, Poor Realization: The book itself contains the expected photos from the events. The accompanying text seemed appropriate for someone with little or no knowledge of 20th century history. While this is not necessarily a fault, it reduces the value of the book to those of us familiar with at least the broad outlines and major events.But the CDs are seriously annoying. Since these accompany a book, I expected that the book would provide the context (date/time/source of the broadcast, and perhaps some historical background) and the CDs themselves would contain minimal narration. Instead, I'd estimate there's five minutes of narration-blather for every minute of historical recording. And blather it is-- often irritatingly banal, platitudinous, and cliched.Did I mention that the narrator sometimes actually talks OVER the historical recordings? This book/recording package could have been so much better.

"Good barrier: This gate looks nice, can be removed when necessary and is a good barrier to keep my toddler out of a more dangerous area of the house. Good for grandparents houses too since it rolls up and is portable. The only reason for the four stars is that the instructions that came with it are poor. I had to figure some of it out for myself. Also, make sure to tell your big kids to be careful and not lean on it and knock it down. But the gate itself is very good.

"Well worth the return trip!: This film was recommended to me by an independent documentary filmmaker. I approached it hesitantly, not expecting much except one or two new tips. What I experienced was an inspirational and emotional event, a journey into the behind-the-scenes look at true indie filmmaking as it was in the 1960's. I know most of the film's fans are surfers. I am not. But I enjoyed this film nonetheless. In fact there were moments where I felt like I'd missed out on something great in the 1960's. More importantly, for independent filmmakers who struggle with the same old notions of how to make and distribute a film, this film offers tremendous insight into out-of-the-box self-distribution. I find this film as valuable, if not more so, than the Robert Rodriguez director commentaries and books. Buy it! You'll want to watch and listen over and over again, but not just for the beautiful waves and scenery. You'll want to watch for the brilliant information.

"Excellent Resource: We just started the first chapter in a business mens group and its been a great challenge, most of the men have been beeliever for quite some time, and the feedback has been great. Although at times very deep and needing some serious time of reflection to take it all in, its an excellent resource to grow you men (of any age or stage in their walk) to a stronger walk with the Lord, challenging you to be more like the master!Our group is going over this book and meeting every 2 weeks.I think I prefer the workbook version, this is not the same, this is a complete book with a coupe challenge questions at the end.The workbook is has much more in the way of self examining questions, but might be more intimidating to some based on the pace and number of questions.There is a leaders guide with an accompanied dvd as well, we only recently found it and ordered it, so I cant say how helpful it wil be.I would highly recommend this resource to anyone.

"""Shameless: The Ego Trip"": Michael Bolton's overwrought vocal stylings have desecrated many pop and soul standards. His cover version of Percy Sledge's ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" was more plagiarism than remake. If you despise that infamous track, stay away from this 1992 compilation, which boasts one of the worst album titles in recent memory. Bolton's arrogance is truly sickening - and an insult to the music artists whose work he continues to cannibalize.

"Too much effort, too little reward: I tried to like this book, like others have noted in their reviews. However, I read a lot at my job, and having to actually work at reading this book made me give it up. I found it difficult to read and boring, and it seemed that a small scenario would be set up, only to turn into nothing after investing plenty of time reading it. I don't know when the actual point of the book was reached, as I gave up halfway through. My ""for pleasure"" reading time was too precious to squander on this book.

"Size matters!: This isn't a bad product, but my experience with this reseller was the reverse of one of the other reviewers: I assumed I would receive a larger size and instead received a medium-small.

"The Praise of Folly: This book must have been revolutuionary in its time. The basic idea, that folly is a major characteristic of humanity, still needs reminding today. It was written in an antiquated languague (Latin) and the translation is equally antiquated, making it adifficult to read at times. Also, the author forgot at tiomes that he set out to praise folly, ranting and raving against it, especially when committed by clergy or princes. A classic worth knowing.

"A few Freakanomics stories: Some of my favorite stories from this book: ""If crack dealers are so wealthy, why do they live with their Moms?""; ""Why is your neighbor's swimming pool 100 times more dangerous than his Colt 45.""; and ""Does having a 'black name' make is harder to succeed?"" (surprisingly, it appears not.)Yes, it's funny, and yes, some of it misuses statistical analysis. But there's also some legitimately interesting research on subjects that most academics consider too mundane for thier taste: the fianncial statements and business plans of an illegal drug cartel (a subject not covered in many academic journals), or the correlation between legalized abortion and crime rate declines.Good book, both for laymen who just want a good read, and for academics who need to remember the real world.

"Not very helpful to me...: This book was a disappointment. Based on other reviews, I thought it would be the happy middle between a ""nuts-and-bolts"" type of book and a textbook with a lot of theoretical discussion. This book was neither, and weak in almost all respects.The book read somewhat like an undergraduate term paper, with overuse of ""witty"" commentary. Based on the large font size, large figures, lots of white space, and way too much extraneous commentary, this book is really much ""thinner"" than its 300+ pages suggest - not a good value.In short, there is not much meat here. I would advise looking elsewhere - compromises are often bad choices.

It's been a few years since I quit but I had danced since I was young and let me tell you, the years of experience were no help at all! I thought that the bonus features, which break down the steps, would help me figure it out but even there she just breezes through them! Rather than repeating a move several times and explaining what she is doing, she does it twice and moves on to the next move. After several attempts to decipher the routines, I gave up and went back to my Crunch videos (which I would highly recommend).

"Super fast setup: For years I was using an older wired D-Link router, and when I switched from DSL to cable, the technician told me my less than blazing speed was a router problem. Since I am only networking two computers and wasn't requiring a wireless network, I chose the basic EBR-2310.Setup with the enclosed disk was super simple and fast. Even a novice can follow the simple instructions. The router comes with a cable (not needed since I already have one installed, a power supply and the instruction disk with everything you need to know on the disk. Extra network software (Network Magic) is included. It, too, installed easily, however, it should be noted that this version is not compatible with Windows 7. Not a problem for my XP machine.In less than 20 minutes my network was functioning. And the kicker: I went from download speed of 321 kbps to 11,218 kbps!If you only require a wired four hub router, this is the one to buy.

"Hard to follow: Although the book claims to be written for the novice programmer, I don't think it is really suited to such a reader. Throughout the book, the author introduces things without explanation. This is particularly a problem with the code samples. Most of the code in the book is taken from other projects that the author had worked on and is often not very illustrative of the points he is trying to make. Also, much of the code has parts that are unexplained. If I had not already been familiar with a few other languages, I don't think I could have followed this book at all.Finally, although Python is often used for text processing tasks like sys admin, cgi, etc., almost all the examples in this book revolve around calendrical calculations. Maybe fascinating for the author, but agonizingly dull for me.

If you want to test playback audio, how can you without hooking this thing up to a TV?Sony's R&D; were flat out stoned the day they overlooked this feature; either that, or completely and utterly naive.

His customer segmentation is quite insightful and applicable as a strategic analysis tool in almost any market situation.

"Painful To Watch: I'm a horror fan and I thought I'd give Jennifer's body a try. I wasn't expecting much but what I got was far less. This movie is borderline incoherent at times and stupid from start to finish (I must admit I fast forwarded the last half hour). The worst part about it is not how dumb it is, but that it thinks it's so smart. You can tell that the screenwriter actually thought there was some legitimate social commentary going on here. The dialogue in this flick is some of the most idiotic I've ever encountered. It's cringe worthy at times and will insult your intelligence at every turn. Avoid at all costs. Utter crap.

"Cookbook is ok, but could be better: I like the idea of this book, but it uses a lot of vegetarian foods that I don't particularly care for. Great for a start up vegetarian, or for a seasoned one, but not really for me. I kept the book, but will edit them more to my liking.

"XAM FACS for Teachers?: This book is poorly written and loaded with typos. There are 3 typos in the dedication alone!

"Large and looking cheap: The watch is large and looking cheap. It can be as large as Casio G-shock. The manual's disclaimer says the watch's features (i.e. azimuth angle) are not designed for real life situations (no use, for fun only). The face seems very easy to be scratched. I paid $20.19, not worth it, in my opinion.

"Not their best work.: Lucero is one of my favorite bands, but if you've never heard them, don't buy this CD first. If you lean more toward the rock side on a rock-country scale, get ""that much further west"" and if you lean more toward the country side, get the self titled CD. S/T is one of my favorites of all time, but this one is produced weirdly and it dillutes the rawness of soul of nichol's voice and the music in general.

"Delightful ""draw them in"" book with many facts: This book is excellent for children who think they dislike history! The style is extremely engaging with a flippant tone that appeals to kids. At first, determining between fact and fiction seems a bit sticky, but after a couple of articles, the style begins to gain a clarity and coherency that allows a reader to know what is real and what isn't even in the most unfamiliar cases. The possible problem with clarity, though, is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.I've read THE ROMAN NEWS as well, and interestingly, while that one is certainly less confused about what's real, THE ROMAN RECORD actually contains more information, both historical and social, even though the books are the same length!

"Simple Plan: The Simple Plan CD is the best CD because Pierre, Chuck, Jeff, Sebastien, and David write all the songs and they tell the truth about life. They don't try to make their life seem perfect like all the other singers/bands. Welcome to my life is the best song on the CD because it tells about Pierre's life. I can relate to his life. I love Pierre.

"Very Good Griddle: Love this griddle, although I find the guard piece useless. It just doesn't prevent grease splatters at all.

"Double-entendre, with a good beat.: Thoroughly enjoyable action movie from beginning to end.When it starts in mock-seriousness to a shuffle-dance sequence that segues into a Sergio Leone parody with Godfather shadings, you are in for an enjoyable ride. Shatters all sterotypes throughout, and yet moves along through thrilling surprise upon surprise. The ghetto set alone, the seed of great martial artists, is very reminiscent of ""Dead End""/""Full Metal Jacket' with jarring delight.Wonderful to see good use of mature actors as martial artists.It also captures the exhilarating wish you find in ""Life Is Beautiful,"" that life can be redemptive and inspirational. It is a wonderful appreciation of Hollywood film work and yet original in many ways. Its awesome imagination elevates its derivative aspects completely.

"What a delightful album!: I bought The Bird is the Word to add to the playlist that my two Macaws listen to during the day. They seem to like music, and music that's lively and with cute voices appear to entertain them. (And I like it too!) The songs ""Just One Me"" and ""Wonderful Me"" are especially cute. What great songs these would be for a little kid, to develop a positive self image. And ""Good Morning Mr. Sun"" is just too cute. I put it at the top of our playlist here, right after ""Morning Has Broken"" which is on theRock-A-Bye Veggiealbum. ""Bird is the Word"" actually gets the birds dancing on their perches, especially if I sing along.This music is entertaining for adults and kids alike and if you like Sesame Street, it's one to add to your collection.

"Happy to See Warren Remembered: Whatever thoughts I have about the individual efforts here, I am happy to see a tribute albu, to Warren Zevon at all. It's interesting to read the reviews taking some of these artists to task for their renditions when many people only knew much of Warren's work by the covers done by Linda Rondstadt.In any event - as with all tribute albums, the results are uneven but the source material is so strong that it makes it worthwhile. Of course - it just makes me want to listen to the originals all over again.

"Phenom!: Ingmar Bergman is the GREATEST DIRECTOR in cinematic history. His movies have that extra something which puts them out in front of the others. Everything from Wild Strawberries to this film display his incredible ability to turn what seems normal everyday occurrences into moving mental delights. I wish he had not given up filmmaking but his greatest love is the same as mine, theater. That is where he practices his craft now. This movie takes us into death but with a twist. Every one wishes to put off death. Our hero, and he is heroic, manages to cheat death out of an early demise. The game of chess is very appropriate for this film. In what other film can we see the plethora of incredible images we se here? What other has the genius to make the simple into the great? Bergman has done everything very well. If you have never seen this movie then what are you waiting for, put on your tennies and run to get it.

"The turning: I had been a fan of Joni Mitchell for years when this came out and I tried to like it but was terribly disappointed. I am not someone who would complain just because this album was a departure from her folkish ways; I admired all earlier phases of her work, and there was something bold and different on each LP. Merely, I find the lyric writing here overwrought and the music weak and forgettable. The only brilliant track is the radical yet tuneful ""Jungle Line."" Obviously, there are many fans of this album, but I believe it's mostly appreciated on an intellectual level by people who can relate to the rather dismal stories on it. It's a bitter house of cards that randomly arranged music tries to hold together.

"The Sum of All Formulas: I have long been an admirer of TC as a plotter and writer, despite his occasional lapses. [But never an admirer of his ""as told to, but written but someone else"" Op-Center products.]With Bear-Dragon, TC has fully descended into Clavell's Disease - that syndrome which causes formerly creative and exciting writers to ACT like they're being paid by the word, which one should not do, even if one IS paid that way. Too many words (a fair-to-good 500-pager fluffed to 1 kilopage), too many subplots, too many characters, too many moral lessons.And the editing! Are TC's editors now afraid to point out to him that he's used the same phrase, metaphor, simile, or analogy several times before - a few hundred pages ago? It's distracting and it's unprofessional. Sure people will buy the book anyhow, because of TC's name, but those loyal readers are owed a better book - I suggest we are owed a better book with each outing. Bear-Dragon isn't it, Tom.

"Only If You Love Alan or Emma: Only watch this movie if you're a fan of Alan Rickman or Emma Thompson (however their roles aren't that big), and maybe Simon Baker. The rest of the cast is forgettable and the story is so-so. Alan puts his usual droll and entertaining spin on his cop character (how many bad cups of coffee can he choke down?) and Emma is very funny as an FBI agent. It was fun to keep tabs on who had the more believable N'awlins accent (it changed from scene to scene) and I really wished those two had more action together.

"Excellent Worship CD: This is a refreshing difference from ordinary CD's. I enjoyed it very much - and continue to come back to it over and over. My only complaint was I found some of the words hard to understand the first few times I listened, but with the help of the word sheet, that was soon overcome. I would highly recommend this CD for anyone who is hungry for a out-of-the-ordinary worship experience. Very scripturally based words. Excellent voice and vocal technique.

He is 6 months old now and is in it at least 3 times a day for anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. He smiles and laughs and loves to do different jumps or just swing himself. It tires him out, too, before his naps or bedtime. He had reflux until he was 6 months so I would always wait an hour after he ate to put him in it and there was never much spit up. This is by far his favorite toy!

"You won't out grow this book in couple of months.: I purchased this book with one goal: to incorporate a database into a web site.

The answers are all there in concise, yet detailed explainations. If you would like to see what I was able to achieve, visit AccessDB.net.There is no fluff in this book. I would not recommend this book to a novice or casual web site developer. It is packed with detail that will quickly swamp you in technology that you have no intention of using. However, if you are serious about implementing ASP, Microsoft database technology and more, on an NT4.0 server, this is an excellent book that will remain useful for a long time.

The only thing I will give it is that it gets the water hot in a minute.Your better off getting the Rival Hot Pot.

"NOT 65 WATT only 45W: As a few others said it is only 45W. Not rated high enough for what they have listed. I need a 65W charged like the description said. Its only 45W. If you want to check this out yourself on an Apple laptop click the top left apple and click about this apple. Then click more info. Scroll down and read what it says for power. If you have this charger it will read 45 watts NOT 65 Watt.Save your money. Your paying for a 65W and getting a 45W that is not enough watts to charge correctly. Your battery will not last as long and when the battery is almost dead you have to wait for the battery to take some charge.

"A Magical Adventure: Rozen Maiden is a delightful anime about a boy with an addiction to ordering things online, and then returning them before the grace period ends. Then one day, an unusual delivery appears. It is a doll. And it is alive.The colors are rich, the characters amusing, the imagery quaint, and the music stirring.I originally watched Rozen Maiden online, and was thrilled with this DVD collection. One may watch in English or Japanese, and there are also subtitles for both languages. The English voice-overs have been left as they can be found online. This set includes the entire first season, second season, and overture.As I was watching the DVD my younger brothers meandered in, and after a few days I could not watch an episode without them huffing at me for starting it without them. Yes. Teenage boys.The tale does end ""unresolved"", but not in a way that leaves the watcher feeling unsatisfied.On the whole, this collection of Rozen Maiden merits five stars from me AND my teenage brothers.

"Disappointing!: I would say most, if not all, college marketing text are more readable than ""Brand Leadership"". Written by two professors of well-known business schools, this is a classic case of trying to make a science out of a hazy subject like branding. This book is laden with inordinate amount of theories, frameworks, models and worse still, jargon. If you can handle all that, fine. But it certainly kills my interest in the study of brand management. Instead of teaching in a straightforward and comprehensible manner, the authors did just the reverse - turning an interesting and relatively intuitive topic into something dry, complicated and unwieldy. If you want real, practical marketing stuff, go for the books by Al Ries and Jack Trout, definitely more fun and easier to read.

What made Scarlett an appealing, memorable heroine was her selfishness, her bullheaded tenacity and almost complete lack of taste. What emerges from this wreck of a book is a jewel-bedecked beauty with a mysteriously attractive spell in her smoky green eyes (is this Zebra, Harlequin or Silhouette?). And Rhett, a strong vital person who was nearly always in control of himself, ""feels threatened"" by his ex-wife's advances; as if that wasn't apocalyptic enough, he marries a frail, delicate Melanie-type to spite Scarlett (the last woman I can see him marrying, for the last reason). If you liked GWTW, do not read this book. There is actually only one reason why you should read it - the miniseries was so bad that the book actually seems competent in comparison

"WORST Reference Book I've Ever Purchased: Not only was this guide not helpful, it was agonizing to use. The index is incomplete, the maps are scattered and inapplicable, nothing is cross-referenced, and the descriptions are more often than not completely irrelevant. I've just returned from my trip to Mexico's Pacific Coast, and found that relying on the book for information was counter-productive, as many facts were missing or wrong. It was more productive to ask anyone than to open the book. Do not spend your money or time on this guide.

"Works well, not perfect: This product works reasonably well. I use it when biking to work by putting it between a glove insert and mitten. I think I've only used it 2-3 times. One problem is that if you carry the hand warmer in a backpack it might get set off by accident. If so then it's not going to be ready when you need it. However, it also does reasonably well if you just put it into your glove right after boiling- It lasts 20-30 minutes that way. I'm not sure how long it lasts when used properly but I suspect a bit longer. It does heat up very quickly (<2 minutes) when used properly.

"108 Reviews: All I have to say is that for a book to be for sale on Amazon for barely a month and already it has 108 reviews has got mean something, and those are only the 108 that were appropriate enough to leave posted. Obviously there is a reason this book polarizes people so much. Whether you believe the book or not, I believe it is a book to be reckoned with. So, love it or hate it, I think everyone should check it out. If you don't want to spend the money, you can get it for free from any Mormon, but that also means you may be invited to listen to a message from the missionaries as well. So, be warned.

"Delightful and thought provoking.: This is a very funny book about a very serious subject. Psychologist Barbara Held has written a hilarious broadside against what she calls ""the tyranny of the positive attitude""--the smug assumption that the best way to deal with our pain and suffering is to hide it by pasting on a smile and pretending that everything is great. Always maintaining a light touch, Ms. Held reveals that ""positive thinking"" can be a callous mask for selfishness--that when we say ""cheer up"" or ""look on the bright side"" we too often mean ""I can't be bothered with your problems."" Wryly championing our inalienable right to complain--to ""kvetch""--she shows us the psychological wisdom of seeking sympathy and sympathizing with the pain of others.

"Love this Soap: I love this soap. I noticed that the other reviewer mentioned the strong smell in the package and that is true but that is not the case when you use it. I have problems with strong scents and perfumes but once this is out of the package the smell dissipates and becomes only a light scent that doesn't linger like most other soaps including those name brand ones from the grocery store.I first smelled lilacs in Buffalo NY (we don't have them in the west) and fell in love with the smell. This soap is the only brand that I have found that captures that same smell. If you love the scent of lilacs give this one a try.

"Contender-Disappointment: The Contender movie had some great musical pieces with a broad number of instruments. The soundtrack is all piano arrangements with some strings, not what was played in the movie. The producers of this CD really missed the boat on this one. The DVD has better music from the movie than the soundtrack CD. The composer Larry Groupe is talented and I look forward to hearing more of his work. The CD soundtrack should be withdrawn and reissued with the music that was played in the movie as it was played in the movie.

"Great Book, Bad EBook: This was a great read. The characters reminded me of what I remember of the inhabitants of Cannery Row and Tortilla Flats. They are engaging and colorful. I am glad to become acquainted with Mr. Russo and will read him in the future.That being said, the Ebook version I read was really poorly done. Random italics popped up throughout and distracting typos abounded. It looked like they'd run it through a cheap OCR and released to Kindle without reading it once. For instance, the ""El"" in ""El Camino"" consistently was printed with a UK Pound symbol sign instead of an E . (I don't have that key in this browser). Very distracting.

Something for every time you feel worthless, when your choices seem self-destructive, when you feel you have little faith & less courage. Wonderful stuff!

"Mommys helper: I find this item to be a lifesaver myself. I wore the Bjorn through two babies. It allowed me to feel a sense of freedom inside and outside of the house. I wore this to many functions for long periods. The two issues I do agree with is that the flap does pop up into the baby's face at time. They should definately put some sort of snap there. Also, when the baby does get to the 23 pound mark, the shoulder straps could use a little more cushion. Otherwise, I love this product.

"Ricky Lake? Really?!: Since when was Ricki Lake a reputable or respected journalist?! Since never. She's ridiculous. She produced this documentary and it is ridiculous. This is a completely one sided documentary. It presents a lot of opinions as though they are facts, and seems to try to demonize women for making the choice to have a ""traditional"" hospital birth.That being said I do think women should be educated about the processes and facts of giving birth, which this film sort of does. In a totally biased, opinion-based, limited facts way. It confirmed my beliefs of disagreeing with home births 100%. The goal should be to have women make an educated choice that's right for them, not a baised choice that's what Ricki Lake wants, as this documentary would have women do.

"Obedient sheep-like children: It amazes me that raising a child is equated with making life easy for mom. How about the child feeling understood, welcome, and worthy? This book pretends that little children have all the faculties of older children and can be indoctrinated so as to be little automatons. They will fit in beautifully with manipulating demigods, and are being trained to not question authority at all. Not the citizens I want to inhabit this country. Why use this book when there are so many more balanced ones that truly use Christian and non-violent principles to raise healthy, respectful, welcomed, and happy children who will become our fellow adult citizens? Because it's cheap? Come on!

Not sure yet about the durability, but it doesn't have to last too long because it will be replaced with a pedal bike in about a year. Easy to assemble, but be sure to tighten all the bolts (even the ones that were already assembled).

"Short but funny: LT's Theory of Pets is a short but very funny short story read by the master himself, Stephen King. King's stories are alway better read by the man himself.

"Not for PST: DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE PST! This item would be great for a much larger knife but could fit 2 PST's (Personal Survival Tools) in it. I should have been very careful to read the measurements but I did read in the detailed specs that this product was for the PST. Saying that this product fits the PST is like saying that a shoe box fits an egg. When I contacted the seller they stated very coldly, that they posted the measurements but had no response to my inquiry of why they stated that this thing fit the PST. They gave me a return number to send it back and 2 pages of regulations stating that the package must be unopened among many other things. How would you know it fit unless you tried it? Any way I would send it back but the return shipping is more than the product is worth (they know that!) I am very unsatisfied with the seller! Gave this 2 stars because although this rides high on the belt, it may be good for whatever monster it is supposed to carry. It is not the PST!

"Very pleased: This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone, but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right.

Instead only a 3 extremely short features are on the final disc, along with advertising for other Showtime series. Finally, the information on each disc about which episodes are on which discs is incorrect!Not only that but these discs featured DRM, so I could not play them on my laptop when travelling, I could only play them on a windows Vista machine that I happen to have an HDMI compliant videocard and monitor. But it would not play on any XP machine.All in all, an extremely poor set created for a tv series that I enjoyed.

"A Nice, Balanced Read: I read Aeroplane right before I readU2's Achtung Baby: Meditations on Love in the Shadow of the Fall (33 1/3), both albums contain Christian themes and both 33 1/3 writers chose to tackle them differently. Catanzarite (Achtung's author) took an album that references Christian themes and centered his essay around it, weaving slight references about album production into a study of the Bible's definition of ""love."" Aeroplane has more overt Christian themes and the writer spent far less time analyzing them. Cooper instead weaved a historical account of Neutral Milk from Mangum's days as a youngster till his last public performance. Both books have their moments, and both books took on an artists pretentiousness in different ways. Catanzarite embraced the themes and disregarded the artist, whereas Cooper discussed how the themes were threaded into the artist's DNA.

If you are only fan of their high-voice Barry Gibb disco stuff, than you might beware this album is much different. I don't like the format of the first disc where the songs are repeated in mono versions. I don't understand what's the need of this, and I usually stop the CD when it gets to repeat the songs, and then go ahead listen to the second disc. The second disc provides some songs that aren't alone different versions of songs on first disc, so it's a true bonus disc. Although some are same.

"discovered during shoulder rehab: i've never heard of the body blade until i went to physical theraphist after shoulder surgery. i thought it was a joke when she presented it to me, but after trying and getting the hang of it i've found the device to be a tremendous tool for strengthening my shoulder and forearms. when i started, i could hardly do it for a minute. after repeated use, two minutes gives me a great workout. my non surgery shoulder can handle it a lot longer and with less effort. i am using it as a guide to compare my healthy shoulder with my surgically repaired shoulder and the contrast is sharp. my goal is to be able to do the body blade for two minutes on each arm with equal effort and fatigue levels. when they are equal, i will know that my surgically repaired shoulder is fully healed. i ordered a body blade for home use since my theraphy is ending and will continue to use it well after i am fully healed.

"Another Great Origami Box Book: I have wanted this book for quite some time, and was finally able to find a new copy for less than $30.00Having folded some of Tomoko's previous boxes, in other books, this book was an easy transition.The octagonal boxes are amazing. Each side is easy to fold, and assembly is within the EASY-MEDIUM range. I would not suggest this to a new origami box folder, but on a scale of 1-10, I would rate the difficulty of this book at a mere 4 or 5. The boxes are easy enough to make that I usually fold one or two while watching a movie, resulting in each box taking 20-45 minutes total to complete, including BOX and LID.This has become one of my favorite origami box books (along withDecorative Origami Boxesby Rick Beech), due to the many interesting variations that each box has.

She needs to travel the circuit to tell her story. Like Marilyn Vandenberg, she has a most interesting story to tell and to hopefully save other children like JonBenet Ramsey...I believe that someone in that house knew that JonBenet was being molested....and were afraid to tell. I can see how the director in the book and JonBenet could be related..they were both show pieces...This book needs to get into the public domain...the real world and truths are what you are going to read here....

Could almost as well turn to French or Spanish, which would improve my language skills.Very nice story, fun, good characters (no, I am not a teenager at all, far from that, but who says adults should limit themselves to ""serious"" - dull? boring? nonimaginative? - stories?) and action enough for my taste.I got exactly what I waited for, and surely recomend it.

"Excellent reference tool: This book is an asset to any student who has to write the dreaded research paper.Chapters are logically broken down by steps in the research process - from narrowing down your thesis to printing out the final draft. Entire chapters are devoted to one topic (such as how to revise your writing and citing your works), allowing for more detailed explanations (you'll even wind up knowing the difference between MLA, ALA, and Chicago-style formats by the time you're done).I was very nervous when just thinking about having to write my paper but when I looked at the sample essays in the back of the book I said, ""I want my essay to look like theirs"" and got to work.You can't go wrong with this treasure trove! - Donna Di Giacomo

"Lyle Let Me Down: I've been an avid fan for about 3 years; one of those who hate country but love Lyle. This is the first of his cds which sounds like a traditional country album - with the exception of the 2 glorious gospel songs. I agree that the music is redundant, but it is also that twangy-kind of country music that Lyle never did. I've listened to it twice, straight through, and probably won't listen to it again. What a disappointment.

"The CIA is evil!: Spoiler alert. This is the WHOLE movie in a nutshell. All members of the CIA are evil. All members of British intelligence are evil. All member of Israeli intelligence are evil. Julian Assange and Bradley Manning are (really, really) good. And this is all TRUE. The actor Sam Shepard tells us so in the ""Making of"" bonus and he knows because he's a friend of Valerie Plame, the faux spy. The action is totally implausible (as it is in most movies of this genre) but the plot (such as it is) is boring. Denzel plays Denzel really well (he's got that down pat) and Ryan Reynolds plays himself (not a compliment). A total waste of time.

"Quality Rod at a an excellent price.: Ordered the LamiGlas Kenai Travel SPINNING Rod for Alaska Fishing adventures. The rod arrived in a damaged rectangular cross section shipping container. Ideally should have shipped in a triangular cross section mailing tube (much stronger). I ordered the rod for durability, quality, and value. The included rod case saved the rod from damage, but when i opened the case.....it was a CASTING rod; not a spinning rod. Needless to say it went back. It was advertised by Amazon as a spinning rod and the stock number on the invoice matched the stock number on the rod. So we assume the folks at Amazon unfortunately don't know fishing tackle. If Amazon fixes this lack of knowledge on their part, subsequent LamiGlas rods offered for sale on Amazon would be good value. Timely shipping would be augmented by adequate shipping containers.

"Adequate rock.: Being a fan of woman fronted rock bands, I anxiously awaited the arrival of this CD. I had never heard of Lullacry before I saw this cd here, and took a chance. In some ways the gamble paid off, in others I found that this disk fell short. While Lullacry are surely talented musicians, and I do HATE to admit this, I think that bands like Evanescence (unjustly bashed) and the incomparable Lacuna Coil have jaded me to subpar musical stylings. While not as orchestral as Fallen nor as in-your-face raw as Comalies, Crucify My Heart is still a good album. While it falls closer to the pop side of rock, every song on CMH has some charm. Recommended.

"Handy for small spaces: I bought this unit to get into a small space in the rear of my engine compartment and it fit the bill. I was drilling out some broken bolts in an exhaust manifold. Using the diamond point tool and the tungsten carbide bit I was able to dimple the bolt enough to use a right angle Ryobi cordless to do the real drilling. Be careful using real drills as the speed is excessive to drill in steel. Cutting using drills in steel requires much slower speeds, and while the Dremel can go slower, it does not develop enough torque at those settings. Be sure to use the collar lock in the attachment and not the spindle lock in the Dremel tool itself or it will break the internal shaft.I also used it for cutting off the stub of the bolt, and found the right angle attachment allowed me into spaces that the tool would not go otherwise.All-in-all a good Dremel attachment but with the same limitations of the basic tool. Use for smaller jobs.

"A stupid album, an insult to the Yes name.: I've heard all of the Yes albums, including 'Union' and 'Big Generator' - which weren't exactly the band's proudest moments. 'Open Your Eyes' manages to crash to a level beneath either of those two subpar albums, both of which did have one or two worthy songs on them.This album is a collection of songs that members were individually working on prior to Yes' reunion in 1996. Their latest record company pushed for a new album to be released quickly on the heels of the vastly more interesting Keys to Ascension II album. The haste and non-cohesiveness shows in this work. Jon Anderson's lyrics are drivel, Steve Howe parts are 'cut and pasted' into songs, rather than serving as inspired compositions. As for the keyboardist - well they didn't really have one at the time, so they flipped between session musicians.Your money is better spent elsewhere. Anyone who is used to the 'classic' Yes sound surely won't find it here.

As much as a hassle it is to plug everything into my laptop, in the long run, it would be much faster than constantly restarting and getting the dock to play nice.Follow the instructions carefully and some things work flawlessly like my mouse and keyboard.

"Great Beginner Orchid Book: As a beginning orchid grower I was a bit intimidated by the whole topic. But after reading Frowine's book, the topic seems much more approachable. I've started with a few moth orchids and they've done well, but now I'm inspired to try some oncidiums and paphiopedilums. I really would like to try some fragrant orchids as well.I like the straight forward cultural information. It's clear the temperature, humidity, and light levels needed for the various orchids. It gives me a sense of which ones to try and which to wait on. The orchid photos in the center are inspiring, though I'd love to see more!I also liked the in-depth listing of varieties for the various orchid types. There's a whole world of orchids out there to grow.A great book for anyone starting out in orchids growing. Clearly written with the usual ""dummies"" humor and lightness. A good starting point for orchid growing.

"Kayla's book review: TWILIGHTStephenie Myers's Twilight is a romance with a twist. Bella Swan is just your average seventeen year old girl, who moves to the town of Forks, Washington with her father. She meets many friends including the mysterious Edward Cullen. She finds herself falling madly in love with him, but she also finds out a big secret: Edward Cullen is a vampire. She gets dragged into Edward's world of mythical creatures and danger. Bella's life will never be the same again.Twilight is a story with romance, action, adventure, and a little bit of horror. Twilight is just one out of four amazing books; there are also New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. Stephenie Myers puts so much personality in her characters it's like Edward and Bella are telling you the story for themselves. I recommend this book to any body eleven and up especially if you like romance...and vampires.

"Great chops + no songs = one hell of a mess: I wanted to like this so badly, but what a flop. The band SOUNDS great, I don't have any problem with the MUSIC here, BUT the songs almost to a one suffer from an acute case of Jaggeritis, an affliction dating back to Dirty Work where the Mick opts to go on for paragraphs when a few well-chosen words would do the trick. Dangerous Beauty isn't bad, great playing, but who is going to remember any of this in a few months? When even the Keith songs don't cut it, what hope is there left? This feels like a half-finished album, a great band playing hot but with too many wordy whiny Mick solo-album reject lyrics to make it worthwhile. This isn't the comeback album or tour of the year. That honor goes to Garbage, playing their hearts out live and with a solid album to boot. What a depressing disc this is.

"Don't believe the hype: I read Catcher in the Rye when i was in my early 20s and found it disappointing given the fact that English teachers and others had called it a ""Classic."" Perhaps we should all guard the term ""Classic"" more carefully.Yes, Salinger explores teen angst. Yes, Holden Caulfield has some universal connection because of the angst. Yes, he addresses phoniness in the world.But those things alone don't make a classic. One reviewer at this site mentioned the fact that there really is no plot, and she is right. If most of us knew Holden Caulfield and were subject to his ranting we would certainly dismiss him and not consider him a classic. I normally finish every book i read, but i got exaclty into the middle of he book and put it awaay for good.If Catcher in the Rye is a classic, then we've lost the ability to distinguish something that is truly classic, like say To Kill A Mockingbird"", from a mediocre novel.

"Dissapointingly Deceiving: If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you. However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work. Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter. While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions.

"Highly Emotional Film: Every time I caught my breath It was knocked right back out of me. I would not recomend watching this with a friend. Knowing this is based on actual events and a trivia fact I read on imdb.com make this an especially moving story for all americans. The trivia fact stated the defense dept. banned virtually all media coverage of fallen vets return home since the 1991 Gulf War until April 2009. Then they offered the ""Taking Chance Crew"" a rarely viewed accurate account of the care that goes into the return of our fallen heros. I'm choking back a tear just writing this review. I pray that our men and women who paid the ultimate price for us are treated no less that the way it is depicted in this movie. It makes me proud and I feel honored to have this soldier's story shared with me. I do not think it is possible to make a more intimate film than this. A truly humbling experience.

"Snake Oil for the Psyche: There is no evidence that Thought Field Therapy does what it claims. Don't take my word for it: look it up! Suggestion and placebo are powerful agents of healing, indeed. But, according to the American Psychological Association, TFT is an approach which ""lacks a scientific basis."" There have been no studies which prove its effectiveness.Granted, as a placebo, it works extremely well, in that it includes a highly ritualized series of exercises which makes extraordinary claims, which creates a high expectation and thus gives results. However, this cannot be seen as a trustworthy treatment for serious problems.Use good judgment, do your own research, and don't trust anecdotal evidence. Pseudoscience does not have a place in standardized treatment, period. People with severe psychological and emotional problems simply do not have time to waste with unverified nonsense with no empirical grounding.

"No substitute for the real thing.: I've seen the Trio a number of times and I think they're an excellent live band, but this DVD doesn't convey that. A lot of it has to do with the amateur quality of it - the shaky cameras, the relentless jump cutting, the poor dubbing. It's kind of offensive, really, that the Trio would release something so low-quality when they obviously have the means to put together a top-shelf concert DVD (or at least one where the sound and the picture even come close to matching). There are also problems with the sound that become apparent within the first two songs; ""Hell Yes"" and ""Madam Me"" are at completely different volumes. For a DVD that got delayed so many times, it sure feels like a rush job. If you're a Trio fan, you're going to buy it, but you'd be better off spending your fifteen dollars on a concert ticket next time the boys roll into your town. I, personally, cherish my memories of Trio shows much more than I do this cheap and ineffective DVD.

"Look elsewhere, not worth the money: I installed these lights on my Ford 250 about a year now, they look very good. However, here is the rest of the story! In the year I have had them installed, one light has already gone out due to water in the lights. I ordered a single light from Recon, which took 2 weeks to arrive and the shipping cost was about 50% of the cost of the lights itself. I have now another light that is leaking and suspect it will go out in about a month or so, and will need to be replaced. This is not unusual for recon products, I have a rear light bar which I have also had to replace due to water. I'm replacing the Recon products with Plasmaglow, which I think has better quality control, but time will tell.

"Do Not Waste Your Money: I had this blender for about a year. The rubber feet kept coming off, so I ended up taking them all off. Lid is hard to put on. The speed control in the front is meaningless. It does not do anything. So you ended up holding the middle speed button with one hand and the blender with the other. You can not leave it and do something else. Then it started leaking and I found the plastic shaft for the blades had cracked. So in the trash it goes. DO NOT waste your money on this product!

"Peyroux's best: I got hooked on Madeline Peyroux after coming across a description in someone's Amazon list of jazz vocalists. Her first two albums are lovely, but perhaps suffer a bit from sounding at times like Billie Holiday imitations (not that that's a bad thing). This album has the most individual character: you get more of a sense of Peyroux as an artist in her own right rather than a remarkable voice in search of the right material. It seems everyone is covering Joni Mitchell's lovely ""River"" these days (see Diana Krall and, before her, Diane Reeves), but Peyrouyx does a nice turn in a duet with k.d. lang.

"Great Wartime Movie: I had not seen this movie in years but was pleased to see it again. It is a classic that tells about the early days of World War II in the Pacific, and how it affects the crew of a B-17 that was winging its way to Hawaii on the fateful day of December 7, 1941. Being that it was made during the uncertain days of the war, it takes some license with the circumstances of events, but it is an entertaining, spirited and flag-waving film that carried the underlying message that we need to work together toward achieving the goal of winning the war. Great acting from the entire cast and very well directed.

"spellbinding, but unsatisfactory at the end: i revel at Harris' ability to make the reader feel sypathetic for Hannibal. He truly is a monster, but i was rooting for him all the way through. interesting that both mason and hannibal have younger sisters, but it is the very ""monster""-Hannibal, who is tender and loving toward his sister even after her horrible death, whereas mason abused his sister and enjoyed watching her suffer. There are lots of interesting parallels in this book. The part with the dinner did make me slightly urpy, but made me cheer at the same time. the only dim spot is the end. It leaves the reader unsatisfied, almost like having dinner and no dessert. other than that a most addicting an enjoyable read.

"Battery Dies: I used to love the blender (two years ago). Fast clean up, easy set up, great for making mayo, hollandaise, whipped cream, soup... Then into hot water and soap, hit the blend and you're clean.But the battery dies and won't hold a charge. This is forseeable, but does Cuisinart offer spares/replacements at reasonable cost? Nooooooooo!Guess what? We'll buy a cheap corded model. We're disappointed. Every product has some limitations, but one should be able to use it for 3 years with no problem and replace failure-prone parts quickly, easily and at a good price, if desired.This product is just another example of bad business and we don't want to reward it.

Maybe if I were born African American, I might've enjoyed it but I'm just some average caucasian guy who'd rather watch, ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Mad TV"". In addition, I'm getting sick of the quote, ""I'm Rick James, b*tch!"" It's not one bit in the least funny! It's just retarded!

"Not just funny if you're a girl!: About a month or two ago, this movie was released in Europe. I saw it in a Sneak Preview. And I have to say it's really funny and refreshing to see this kind of movie from the women's point of view.Yes, it was a perfect movie for my mood. I wanted to have a good laugh, and ""The Sweetest Thing"" definately delivered. From the introduction of Christina's character (by a bunch of frustrated males) to the hilarious scenes when the three heroines go to a nightclub, and Christina meets her match. All three women are memorable, and what's more; perfectly believable. And you can tell (don't leave right away when the credits start rolling!) that the actrices have had a lot of fun making this movie.The strength of the movie is it's energetic pace and it's raunchy humor! In a spotlight review, someone regarded to this movie as a Chick-Flick. I only partly agree. Why? Because this movie is just as funny if you're a guy!

"Almost as Good as Self-Titled ""Korn"": Korn has yet again proven that they are fresh, original, and always creative. ""Issues"" is very melodic but keeps a tight hold on their basic sound - being very heavy, heart-pounding, emotional music. While not as exceptionally powerful as their self-titled debut, Korn has shown that they know how to rock. There's tons of great songs on the CD that all have a unique sound - the single ""Falling Away From Me"" is creepy and contrasts between a haunted melody and heavy guitar beats that make you want to get up and jump. ""Trash"" is pure Korn, with great guitars and emotional lyrics from Davis. Also standing out are ""Make Me Bad"", ""Somebody Someone"", and ""No Way"". Finally, ""Let's Get This Party Started,"" which appears near the end of the CD, suprised me with the absolutely meanacing chorus that grabs your attention and screams in your face, ""Listen!""

"Seagate refuses to honor the warranty: I bought this drive in May, 2007. It was advertised as having a three year warranty, and I have a PDF copy of the Maxtor spec sheet that confirms this model has a three year warranty.The drive failed in August, 2008, 15 months after purchase. Seagate, which bought Maxtor back in 2006, refuses to replace the drive or honor the warranty. They wrote ""We have seen this before, and I am sorry to say the drive only had a 1-year warranty"" -- clearly, the reason they've seen this before is because the drive was marketed as having a three year warranty.A longer warranty doesn't mean a hard drive is less likely to fail. But I would never buy a drive with a one year warranty. And I would never buy from a company that refuses to honor its warranties.That's two good reasons not to buy this drive.

The first book I red had a murderer running about in it! This are NOT for the kiddies but for the teens and maybe the young adults. Unlike today, the books still hold onto the wonder of flight, in its early history. When the food was good, the service was always done with a smile, and nobody thought about crashing into the ground with all the flames and screaming and stuff.

"Does not live up to the original: Silence of the Lambs was a critically acclaimed success- a compelling, suspenseful, moving movie. What does the movie studio do? Try to duplicate the success as quickly as possible to strike while the iron is hot, and create a sequel. And like most sequels, this movie doesn't live up to the original.Even veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this movie, in spite of his wonderful performance. Julianne Moore replaces Jodi Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, who squares off against Dr. Hannibal, who taunts her from across the Atlantic ocean in obscure ways.I can almost imagine how the script outline took shape. The story seems to be the product of anxious Hollywood pitchmen frantically throwing out ideas to a studio executive, grasping for success. In any event, they have produced a disjointedly contrived story, punctuated with brief scenes of gory violence.If you must see this movie, rent it.. don't buy it.

"Fantastic romance novel, will make you want to visit Wyoming: I read this on my kindle in one day. I couldn't put it down. I read a lot and enjoy many different genres, and this is a fantastic example of a contemporary romance that really gets it right. Amazing chemistry between the main characters, well-drawn secondary characters, swift moving (but not rushed!) plot, satisfactory ending. I felt very connected to and invested in the characters, which doesn't happen often to me when reading romances.The only reason this review isn't five stars is because sometimes the writing was over the top cheesy. There were several groan-worthy lines and a few ridiculous plot twists, but overall the characters and their interactions were very believable. I would love to read more from this author.

"Absolutely AWFUL!: You would think a Championship special for a basketball obsessed fan base and program like Kentucky, would put together a stellar DVD. That is not even close to what this piece of garbage is. The editing is choppy and the narration is incorrect and all over the place. Its as if this was put together by an amateur high school media student. You would have the narrator saying one thing while something completely different was on the screen. Then the highly anticipated rematch with Indiana in the Sweet 16 is only given TWO PLAYS! A foul by Davis in the first half and a rebound in the final seconds of the game. Then the national title game gets maybe 3 plays worth of highlites and then it cuts to the team driving into Rupp Arena for the celebration and then abruptly ends.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Cross your fingers and hope CBS puts together an official DVD because this is absolutely a waste of money. There are better youtube videos out there of the 2012 Kentucky Basketball season.

"**Season Three** ...The third best...: Season three was, from the first couple episodes of the season, the worst in the series. It wasn't until the Darla troligy did things pick at all for me. From there on out the season kept getting better and better, until it finally peaked at the season finale. The addition of Connor was one of the geatest things in Angel history. While I like season four and five better, this season definitly is better than the first and second IMO.The DVD is looking great, planty of featurettes to go around, some bloopers, and even screen tests. Widescreen looked great for season two, so it should look even better this time.Hopefully Fox keeps up its six-month intervals so that season four and five (my favorites) will be out before this time next year. Season four was like watching a season of 24, you never get board, and season five, now with Lindsay's return as a big bad, is going to possibly become my favorite season.

"OK, not great: OK, first of all, judging by the some of the losers who do not know how to spell or use proper grammar that have reviewed this movie, I guess I should expect THEY would like it, so let me offer an intelligent opinion.This movie had a lot of funny scenes, but a lot were downright crude and disgusting too. The topless scenes and most of the biological function scenes were totally unnecessary. I think some of the funniest parts were bringing in references to some of the classic 80's teen movies which most of the audience (who were under the age of 20) really did not get. My friend and I (teenagers of the late 80's/early 90's) seemed to be the only ones in the theater who GOT all those jokes. I think the movie was OK, but only for the few, selective good laughs. Wait for this one to get to the dollar movie!

"""PERFECT"" DARK is the biggest OVER statement of this year.: MAY I WARN YOU, BUY AN EXTENSION PACK ALSO, THE GAME IS ABSOLUTLEY BOARING WITH OUT IT.Perfect Dark took goodness knows how long to come out and all the hype for it was well , NOT WORTH IT , Goldeneye 007 was made buy the same company who made perfect dark and I have 007 and all the levels in Perfect Dark were 007 levels with a few extra items in them like Boxes and Doors, I know all the other reveiws say it is a great game with 5 stars but if you have no extension pack the game has only 5 ""PRACTICE"" levels and they are boaring as there are no people or any thing of that nature to destroy .

"Morrie: In His Own Words: This book is truely a wonderful learning experience about how people should treat and live their life. Its words of wisdom are stated by an old dying man named Morrie Schwartz suffering from ALS which helps him better to understand himself and add to his prospective of living and dying in addition to his other life experiences. They boil down mainly to being more open and loving(telling more would ruin the magic of reading it). I am a living testament that the advice Morrie has to offer works like a charm for it has made me a better person to myself and around others by practicing what he says as much as a can to a certain extent. As a book it is very easy to read and understand. However what took one point of this book is its originality(thanks to Tuesday's With Morrie, which has almost the exact same theme and lessons).

"VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!: Harmon\Kardon seriously let me down with this below standard product. Let me start with the 1 good thing. They fit my ears. But what good is it to fit my ear if they sound like CRAP! The come in some fancy case that I don't care about because you cant use the case for any thing. But the sound quality is just sooooo poor. I tried every different eq setting that I have on my ipod, but none could make these earbuds sound worth a crap. They have no bass, no distinction what so ever in levels of music. I listen to all genres of music and none of them sounded worth listening to. I used them for about 5 minutes and went back to the earbuds I got with my ipod that hurt my ears. I had actually rather be uncomfortable with the others than I had listen to these pieces of crap.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!!!!!!!!

"Painfully boring: As a working screenwriter, I usually have the bad habit of buying a screenwriting book when I'm creatively stuck to hopefully jump start my imagination, or to help me shift perspective slightly. When will I ever learn.The book's Table of Contents looks impressive, but it was clear from the outset the author is an academic. I was truly hoping for something inspired with a voice and point of view. The prose requires a significant effort on the readers part. I felt like I was swiming through molasses.The film examples were cursory and the book in general, I hate to say is BORING.I felt like I was digging through acres of barren terrain for a few tiny nuggets of insights. I hate writing these negative reviews, but I felt compelled to this time.The information Howard supplies is valid if you are a film student, but not if you're in the trenches trying to complete a screenplay that isn't working and you want to discover why.

"From The Book: Within cities, gay life has always been marginalised. Despite the fact that their significant places are often centrally placed geographically within cities, gay communities are not centrally placed in the political, social and cultural lives of cities. These international accounts draw on first hand ethnographic research and reflect the responses of gay men in particular to the changes that have taken place during the last 25 years in urban settings. They look at the physical and spatial development of gay places, at the same time as viewing the social placing of the communities that use those places.The cross-disciplinary studies within this book look at the tensions that arise between gay communities and their cities, the political and economic implications to city planners of the ""pink pound"" and the legal and social implications for gay men as they attempt to reconcile being both the outsiders and insiders of city life.

"It will ""surprise"" you: This has to be the worse Korean movie I've seen....ever. It's complete with laughable attempts at drama, characters you don't care for, and....(fill in with whatever you don't like).The action scenes are a joke. The director of Shiri wasn't known for action, as you can easily seen from both of these films. The ""action"" is choppy and just plain stinks. It needs to take ques from Hong Kong.***Spoiler ahead***: please, please, someone tell me why would a commuter train go right into a nuclear power plant????I can't believe I wasted money watching this. It's not all bad, the score is quite good, and the running time is under 2 hours. Plus it's a 1-disc feature, so disposal is very easy.And no, it's not from Hollywood, because Hollywood at least wouldn't make such pathetic attempts at adding depth into this.

I quickly found out that it wasn't a practical living container and moved to a 1.5 gallon tank with a filter and a small heater pad. Being in the larger tank he absoultely flurished, and within time, once I was able to save up my money, I purchased a 5.5 gallon tank with a heater/filter combo and have since moved him into there.I still keep this small tank around when doing water changes. It works well as a temporary housing unit, and could even be used as a sick/hospital tank.I would not recommend this tank as a living condition for any fish.

Mr. Carrey has demonstrated that he will do anything for a cheap laugh, money,and publicity. The man is a narcissist totally. This movie is going in the Garbage where it belongs. I have lost all respect for Jim Carrey. Just another overpaid moron actor who think of themselves as gods rather than appease and take the time to ponder the only true God.

"Not great for newborns.: I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home.

"Innovative and Inspiring: Cache Girl Saves the World covers all the bases: the format is new and innovative, the photographs and the narrative are beautiful, and the theme is inspiring. Cache Girl follows the story of Ta'li, portrayed by Thirza Defoe, as she attempts to make an understanding dust. The story begins with her as a young runaway, and it follows her as she communicates with nature to make the understanding dust. The photographs fantastically encapsulate each moment, while Stone's words are both lyrical and striking. You will be impressed while watching this novel in visions, by both the story and the story's format, and you will walk away feeling the urge to save the world.

And I am sorry that I bought the others too... maybe I will get something out of the Potty version. I am much better off with What to Expect in the First Years and / + the Toddler Years version.

"A Move Into Enlightenment: Dr. Judith Miller's gripping journey from a traditionally trained therapist to essentially what she calls herself now, a mystic, is enlightening and thought provoking all at the same time. It's the kind of book in which the reader has trouble putting it down. I believe anyone who reads the book will be transformed subtlely in ways that can be described in three steps: 1) one begins to remember instances in which coincidences had occurred yet a feeling inside knew it was more; 2) if one pays more attention they'll begin to realize that such occurrences have always been going on, and it is society that has called them pure happenstances without explanation; and 3) fear will settle in, and one might begin to think he/she is crazy if she begins to experience some of the more paranormal stages that Judith Miller traveled through. Dr. Miller's book is probably most important to that one person who needed validation of his/her experiences and found them in Direct Connection.

"A Good look at America - at 10 mph: This book is a delightful metaphor for our journey through life. We set out with goals in mind and find that life surprises us with twists and turns not unlike the roads the author followed on his cross-country trek. This is a journal of the daily frustrations with weather, health, and the logistics of riding a bicycle from Friday Harbor, Washington, to Key West, Florida. It is told partly through the author's email along the way to his wife and friends in Seattle (the introduction to each of the chapters), but mostly by his personal journal of the trip formed during and after. His intimate writing style lets one get to know him and the landscape along the way, but more important is his capture of the peoplescape - literally a cross-section of each state he visited through the people he encountered, and a refreshing look at our American society as we live it. I enjoyed it very much. More pictures would have got it 5 stars!

"Better products out there: There are tons of products out there that allow moms to hold baby and have hands free. This is dangerous to mom (back problems?), the strap can't be left attached to the carseat in the car (choke hazard) so it is extremely inconvenient if you have to constantly hook/unhook it, and it seems way too easy to off-balance mom and send her for a fall.If you want hands free and hold your baby, look into actual slings, wraps, carriers designed for that purpose - they have been used for thousands of years in many different cultures. If you get the proper kind, it will be comfortable and safe for mom and baby.If you are in need of something to hold your child's carseat between the car and house, get a snap and go or something that's lightweight and easy and safe to pop open.

"just terrible: this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awful. the original movie, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior. It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco. Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment. The eurythmics soundtrack is deplorable, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie. The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack. All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square! If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better. The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior. But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.

"The scariest thing here is the transfer: This full-screen version looks like the print was dragged up the mountain behind a truck. It's shocking what a lousy job Warners did here. Avoid it at all costs. Supposedly the only decent DVD trasnfer in the Kubrick collection is 2001, and that's not done by Warners. The DVD is actually a repackaged MGM DVD. Hopefully Criterion will work on Kubrick's stuff and some point and give the public a product worth paying for.

"What's on the menu tonight you ask?: Lots, I answer with a grin...Love this writer and her book! ""Scarlet Feather"" by master storyteller Maeve Binchy is one fun read. Loved it! The characters are fun. The dialogue easy to follow. And, the plot is a real page turner. This was my first Maeve Binchy book and she will perhaps be glad to learn it won't be my last. I've ordered two more since I read ""Scarlet Feather"" and I look forward to reading them.

"A fraud, in a creative sense.: James Patterson has developed a ""cookie cutter"" formula for churning out low quality novels. It appears that he partners with others who write the books, then he markets them with his well known brand name. For some time I have put up with this mediocrity. No more. I'm done. Just my opinion, folks, but a well deserved one.

"Memory Tips That Work: This is a well written guide for improving memory skills while reminding us of the skills we already know.

I plan to use it again in the future as well as other guides written by this author.

"An incomplete course: I don't know where to begin. Unorganised layout; the most difficult to follow beginners book I've ever read; full of phonetical blunders and inadecuate/inaccurate pronunciation guides; a mixture of patronising explanations and way-over-my-head technical vocabulary (without explanation, incidentally); too few illustrations along the way, and not enough exercises to practice what you've barely learned. I'm now looking for a Hebrew book in the style of Wenham's 'elements of new testament greek'. Look for an old style grammar/instruction book of the language, don't go for new-look books.

"Pretty Good Bang for the Buck!: I bought this monitor/TV for my daughter to use in her room. Space is limited and to be able to use this as a TV and a computer monitor is a plus. As a computer monitor the quality is acceptable. Certainly not the best around. As another reviewer mentioned, it does have some minor quirks, but you get used to them.I hooked up the TV with a progressive scan DVD player and the quality was pretty good. I decided to buy an up-converting DVD player to get 1080i (which this monitor can handle)and connected it with a HDMI cable and I was very impressed. After tweaking the picture for better color accuracy, my daughter now has herself a nice little home theatre.And yes, all the other reviewers are absolutely correct concerning the audio. In plain english, it's crap. So, I bought an inexpensive 2.1 sound system which hooks up to the headphone jack and that took care of that complaint.All things considered, I would recommend this product.

"A die hard Def Leppard fan that was not impressed!: There are two DVD collections out by Def Leppard. ""Historia/In The Round In Your Face"" and this one. The best way to describe these two DVD's is the rise and fall of Def Leppard. This one, of course, being the fall. This DVD is Def Leppard without Steve Clark, and in my opinion Def Leppard died when Steve did. They do a good acoustic ""Iggy Stardust"" on this DVD. Maybe they ought to play David Bowie songs from now on. They don't seem to have any direction, and it shows in this DVD. People that liked their ""Slang"" album might like this, but if you are a fan from their 80's music style, I would think twice before buying this one. Vivian Campbell doesn't even come close to playing like Steve Clark....... by a long run!

"A pleasure to read after many years of teaching: This is a book you shoud read, if you do any kind of teaching. It approaches teaching from a point of view which is deep and rare: what are the traits or virtues that make a good teacher? This is not a book about tools or techniques. It is not a book about methodology. These are important, but complementary. Finally, this book is also very, very well written, as far as a non-native, not too proficient English speaker such as myself can judge. I'm looking forward to reading other books by the same authors.

I hope Micheal Stackpole and Dark Horse continue with Star Wars, because they seem to have the right innovations needed to keep it fresh.

"Should be called ""pre-pilates"": I really, really, really wish I'd read the reviews before I purchased this DVD.I have been doing pilates for about 18 months, have attended classes, read books and through other DVDs(Denise Austin and Jennifer Kries). I just felt like a change from what I've been doing, which was why I bought this DVD.The reviewer who said this DVD was for complete beginners was absolutely right. The DVD contained some of the exercises that my teacher had us do in the first 1-6 lessons, to ensure that our allignment was correct, and as stretches. So, for someone who's never done pilates before, this is quite a good DVD, but not challenging for someone who's been doing pilates for a while. Lynne does explain quite well which muscles you should focus on and gives good tips to ensure that you're doing this.Overall I was really disappointed - if I'd read the reviews before I wouldn't have bought this DVD - it's definitely not a challenging pilates workout.

"non-mormon perspective: After reading the national reviews for Brigham City I purchased the DVD in hopes it would be at least mildly entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised to be watching a sophisticated, tight, well acted and ingeniously directed murder mystery that would have made Hitchcock proud. Aside from the few gratuitous inclusions of Mormon trumpeting, this film rises above to evoke a fear that touches its audience. Kudos Mr Dutcher, you are a true master of your craft. I highly recommend this film to murder mystery fans and fans of fine filmmaking

"Another Smith Classic: Kevin Smith has done it again. This is a wonderful, insightful movie. It is one of the only movies to truthfully look ot love. It is not all flowers and candy, and it does not always resolve itslef in a perfect, go and make your 1.4 kids type of way. The ending is truly cathartic, and a true payoff. The movie is very funny, and at times very frank and even painful. My only complain in this movie is it has less of Jay and Silent Bob than the other movies. If you enjoyed Clerks, Mallrats, and/or Dogma, you'll love this movie. If you have ever been in love, you'll love this movie. If you have a pulse, you'll love this movie.

It seems after a few trips through the dishwasher they just didnt' seal up right. One never did seal right and I pitched it, I tried other nipples first, but it was the bottle. It seems the tight ones don't let the air back in very well and create that vacuum and the ones that do release air drip some.

"Overly harsh punishment: A sleazy showcase of sadism, slapstick and sentimentality, this version of The Punisher is only marginally better than forgettable Dolph Lundgren version. Good performances from Rebecca Romijin, Ben Foster and John Travolta, and a cameo by Roy Scheider, don't quite make up for the way the film turns slaughter into a joke by veering drunkenly from the subfusc to the ridiculous.Reviews I've read suggest that the directors' cut manages to explain away most of the plot holes, but I feel no urge at all to see it: I'm not sure what comics readers did to deserve this, but whatever it was, we've been punished enough already.

After repeated calls to Optoma over a period of 4 months they finally sent out a replacement set (used/refurbished I assume). The DLP lamp on that set failed and I went back to the dealer where I purchased the set. The new lamp worked only for a short time and now the TV will only turn on after repeatedly attempting to power up over a 1/2 hour time period. Optoma technical support is no help at all. Optoma treats their customers like dirt. If you buy an Optoma product pray that you do not have any problems. By the way, the dealer where I purchased the TV no longer sells Optoma's line of products.

"Not a bad book, but definitely up to Ms McNaught's standards: If you're a first time reader of Judith McNaught's work you probably will enjoy this book. If you are a fan of her previous works, then you will be disappointed. Like ""Remember When"", I did not feel this book lived up to her usually standards. The characters lack their usually depth, although they are not as stale as in ""Remember When."" What I have always enjoyed is the attention to character interaction that Ms McNaught gives her stories. In her last two books I've felt they've have been rushed, and that she has not given them her usual attention to detail. I hope her new book shows a return to her older style of writing. If you are looking for a fantastic contemporary romance I suggest either ""Paradise"" or ""Perfect."" My favorites have always been the historical romances, and for that I suggest ""Almost Heaven"" or ""Something Wonderful""

"14 Degrees Short: I tested the AE-9.5. If it worked as advertised, it would be a great little piece of equipment - but it doesn't. It is advertised to achieve an 84 degree rise at .75 gallons per minute. The best that I could do after ten tests was a 70 degree rise. Here are my test results.Incoming water - 48 degreesGallons per minute - .75 GPMHeated Water Temp - 118 degreesI did hit 125 degrees or 77 degrees once but not for .75 gallons per minute.For my test, I set the AE-9.5 on a table about 30 inches off the floor. I wired the unit to 240 volts. Actual voltage, 242. The heated water was directed into a two gallon pail using a two foot section of hose. The distance from the unit to the pail was minimized so as not to affect the results. I used a sealed thermometer to measure the water temp. Each test ran for two minutes.I called the Bosch support line for help but it was after hours and they weren't able to answer my questions.

"Southern 'Tallica: After you do ""The Black Album,"" one of the best records of all time, where do you go? Apparently, if you're Metallica, you temper your metal edged agression with a newfound bluesy style. Many(and that's a huge understatement)people consider this record a sellout, but that's just not true. Sure, it's a departure from the chugging rhythms of their past, but even without that, Metallica prove they can still knock you down. ""Wasting My Hate"" has a laid back intro, followed by slammin' C.O.C. style riffs. Actually they sound like a more metal version of C.O.C. And listening to ""Ronnie"" and the sludgy ""Cure"" you can hear why.The change in style really benefits James Hetfield's vocals, as he sounds more down to earth, with more personality than in the past. Guitarist Kirk Hammett still serves up volley after volley of tasty wah-wah solos, although he at times sounds a little too laid back. This is a minor complaint on a successful transitional album.

"WOW: To Kill a Mocking BirdBeing recognized as one of the greatest pieces of American literature in the twentieth century, stating To Kill a Mocking Bird is fantastic, should go without saying. I recommend whoever is considering reading this doesn't try to figure everything they can about the book before they do so. It's better to into on a clean slate. Some references and lifestyles may be shocking but one must remember where, and when it takes place. Reading novels from today's biggest names in literature, its clear many are influenced by Harper Lee. Lacking clear violence, true love, and other huge themes seen in books and movie now a days, some may say its boring but reading thoroughly, one can see the painful conflict and romance in its pages. In summary, this piece may in some ways be offensive, but it reflects history, unjust prosecution, and the truth of the world.

"Like Taking a Bus Trip with Someone who Smells: The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden. This is just a lumbering, poorly photographed piece of derivative drivel, full of grunting extras scampering around in animal pelts and more dank, trash-strewn sets than I ever care to see again. Humphrey Bogart overacts, and this is an understatement. He chews up so much scenery he probally got indigestion when filming was done. Anyone who questions this movie's distinction as being one of the worst of the 20th century, has a few screws loose. A crime against celluloid.

"Jean, where is the plot?: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00466HQ1A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis book reads as if it were a pastiche of parts of previous books. I came away with the feeling that there was no real plot to this book. My brother, who is a great Auel fan, called me (because I am a writer and have a doctorate in creative writing, and he is an engineer) to ask me what I thought of the book. When I told him that it seemed to lack a plot, he said in a very relieved tone, ""Well, I couldn't find one, but I thought maybe it was just me.""I hope the next book, which I gather is the last and which is already somewhat overdue, is better than this.

Those who hate on her, are those who are only focused on what others have said about her. No one has ever said that just because you dress a certain way, that it affects your music. I think Mariah has thought a lot about what she want's to do as an artist and as her own being. Mariahs' music has always pulled me in, and her new Heartbreaker CD, will be mine soon enough. I recommend it to those who like this style of music. She has always surprised me in every CD, and I'm positive I'll enjoy Heartbreaker!

"Great step stool, sometimes hard to collapse: This step stool is great as far as being able to reach high places. I love that it has 3 steps, when many step stools only have 2, so I can get into higher places. It's sometimes hard to collapse once I'm done using it. This may improve over time, as I use it more and collapse it more. And I suppose if it's hard to collapse, that means it's fairly sturdy when I'm climbing on it!

"some useful info in an obnoxious package: While there is interesting and possibly usable information in the book, Dr. Stanley comes across as a smug, tedious and obnoxious individual, I was very tired of spending time with him by the time I finished. There are a number of no-brainer insights presented as if they were the wisdom of the ages - decamillionaires are unlikely to play the lottery...hmmm. The spouse selection chapter reminds me of Gordon Liddy. It seemed there were twenty five mentions of the importance of clipping coupons before shopping for groceries - sorry, I just don't believe this is the key issue. And while Stanley has a point about interpersonal skills being as important as academic excellence, I am a little queasy about feeling sorry for the high school class president and football star afraid he won't measure up against the ""class brains"". I think you can get the maximum out of this book by skimming it in twenty minutes at a bookstore.

"Solid overview of basic concepts: This is a good introduction to basic math skills, but I don't think that it will be very useful for a high school student. Upon entering high school, a student should have mastered such topics as fractions, percents, and integers, and if he or she hasn't, then he or she is in trouble.The DVD consists of what seem to be simple PowerPoint slides. The voiceover is clear and spoken at a good pace. Each lesson lasts a few minutes, and ample time is provided to complete the given examples. Each lesson includes good definitions of key terms and ends with a quick review of the material that was covered. Overall, I think that this DVD would likely be more beneficial to an elementary school or middle school student who is looking for an overview to material that he or she has already been exposed to in school.

"""Magia"" There is Magic in this album!: ""Magia, tus labios tienen magia..."" Magic, your lips have magic. Lyrics like that and many more about love and romance make this album another smashing album by Jerry. The album starts out strong and finishes even stronger with ""Tierra sin Sol,"" one of the many great songs on this album. Jerry even delivers a song, ""Gracias,"" about giving thanks to God for his life, family, and his culture. You can't get any better than that. The most memorable tracks to me are ""Magia,"" ""Amor Magico,"" and ""Tierra sin Sol."" But to be honest they all jam and if you don't have this album you need to get it. It's about love and romance, what else do you want. Get it!

As it turns out, this is a cheap Eureka vacuum cleaner. First time i tryed to clean under a chair, i discovered the brush head lifts off the floor completely. Forget cleaning under a bed. It's noisy, looks like cheaper tthan normal plastic parts. It also left scuff marks all over my wood flooring. I could get the same vacuum cleaner but branded Eureka for a lot less money if thats what i wanted. For me, it's going back for a refund. My advise, stay away from this product. If it is an Electrolux you want (as i do) then be sure you buy the real item. Don't know why, but the real Electrolux is now called Aerus or something like that. Same great products but a different name now.My 3 cents worth,

"Highly Recommend!: I have never written a product review online before but my experience with this razor definitely deserves one! I recieved this on Wed, charged it and began use on Thursday. I have used it once wet and one dry and loved the results of both! It is quiet, provides a close shave already (claims to improve over three weeks!), and gives me NO razor burn. The whole reason I bought this razor was to try to find something that would eliminate razor burn for me and I had yet to succeed after trying all kinds of epilators, razors, depilatory creams, and other electric razors. This finally has me happy! It may not give the perfect smooth shave that my sister always seems to get right out of the box but I'm very satsified! I was never able to shave more than twice a week before so this will give me a closer shave with a better experience hands down! Can't wait to see what happens after the 3 week point!

"Mutter struggles with Sibelius - and loses: This is one of the worst Sibelius Concertos I've ever heard. Mutter struggles once again with the technical challenges of the piece and comes up short in terms of artistry. Her entrance in I is too muddled, and she slows down too much during technically difficult passages. In this case, her artistic ideas do not serve well in preserving the clash between 'fire and ice' in this piece. I would recommend Sarah Chang's Sibelius Concerto, a far superior recording.

"A must have for suncast storage buildings: We have the B-52 storage shed for our small yard, and it holds everything we need. But, these shelves provide extra room so that everything isn't on the floor.

They are a little narrow, as other people have mentioned, but they would probably take up too much room otherwise. The way they are made really maximizes your space. My only criticism is that they should be about $5-$10 cheaper...it's just a few molded plastic pieces. But, we're happy, and they serve their purpose, so 5 stars!

"Great Christmas movie and music: I'm fond of the original of this film; ""The Bishop's Wife"". But, contrary to your own reviewer, I think this film is just as good, and an excellent update with lively gospel/jazz musical score. Ok, it may be too sweet for some people. But the cast does a great job with the material, which is clean, non-violent comedy focused on family values and which sends you out with your feet tapping to a great jazz rendition of ""Joy to the World"".

"A solid beginner's workout: It was a good workout! I'm a beginner with a bit of practice (on and off for about 6 months) but very little skill (not much strength and terrible flexibility). I actually broke a sweat, and kept sweating for most of the routine.The routine had great flow, the background (set in Maui) was attractive, and nearly all the poses were described well. There were a couple of times where she skipped saying what to do next and just did it, but that was pretty rare, and it was easy to catch on by just looking up at the screen. The music was peaceful, nondescript and unobtrusive, as it should be. I only had one really minor gripe about the video, and that was that she spent too much time at the beginning going on and on talking. I can fast-forward through that, though, so it's not a huge concern.

"Drywall Yes ---Deck NO!: I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said ""Drywall and Deck"" Drill. Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4's with 2 1/2 screws. I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation. I ended up pre-drilling each hole. Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping. Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go. I finished the job. My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly. I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck. I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed. Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem. This is not a deck screw drill.

Besides there is a human sight all around the film and even it runs slow paced in many moments and lacks of the accustomed kinetism, the highlight aspect to remark is its deep realism .Worthable film , though ny favorite film of Bond is Goldfinger and Thunderball this work is to me the third in the list of the great Bond series with the best Bond ever ; Sean Connery .

In theory though, this is a very skin and body friendly shampoo, so if you've never had a problem with shampoo leaving your hair feeling 'gross' then totally give them a try, otherwise I recomend avoidance.

"money jar: Our money jar broke after the first use. It's cheaply made and not worth the trouble. Its spring mechanism broke at the count of 76.00. I can't return it since I threw away the receipt, so I think we are stuck with a very expensive plastic jar!

"Hungry, dirty, real...: Shade was the first one of the Emily Devenport books that I picked up, at the last count I actually had 3 copies of the book. Shade plays out like a true street kid, hungry all the time, almost maniacally looking for a way out and in more need than she can cope with. The way she responds to the aliens in her world is priceless, this is it, this is the book that I have been waiting for AFTER humanity has been introduced to EVERYONE else in the galaxy. No more of this, we are the superior beings because of X... Shade is a delightful read, a true piece of mind candy and the kind of book that I recommend to my friends.

"Boils without whistle: I purchased this kettle because it was more expensive than another unit that was reviewed poorly for not whistling when the water came to a boil. However, this unit appears to have the same flaw.The lid/button linkage seems to be poorly designed - the lid never closes completely, therefore steam escapes without blowing thru the whistle hole. I fiddled with pulling the red button up and pressing the lid down, but other than a constant firm pressure holding the lid down, the lids not going to close tight enough to work correctly.Stainless, yes. Tea kettle, sure. Whistle, no way.

"Very good teen book: The Catcher in the Rye is a great book that teenagers can relate to very well. It captures almost all of the emotions that teens go through. It tells stories that most authors wouldn't usually write about. It gives you first hand experiences that the narrator goes through and tells you exactly how he is feeling. It is an easy read and very enjoyable.

"I can't believe they have the nerve to charge for this book: This book is terrible. It has only the most minimal of information, with building addresses, but no property managers, no specifics on amenities, no detailed unit information. Basically, this book just contains some extremeky generic information along with some amateurish looking graphics as filler. If you are looking to rent, then Gabriel's apartment guide is a much better resource. As for sales guides, I have yet to see one that is worth the money. The NY Times online has some good information about recent sales by neighborhood.

"A Healthy Dose of Truth: Those who profess atheism are themselves followers of a religion: the religion of secular humanism, and therefore an active assertion in denying God. Thus, all worldviews are religious worldviews. Comfort speaks lovingly, yet with fire. His logic is superb and he appeals to common sense, reason and the human conscience. This is the book that had American Atheists national spokesman Ron Barrier running scared. I highly recommend it as an apologetic to give to unsaved persons, or for Christians who want to know how to witness to atheists more effectively.

"I really just bought it so I could expand my Game Boy...: Game Boy. For fourteen years it has been seen in the hands of children as they are mesmortized by the classics such as Pokemon Blue and Red or Super Mario Land. Now Game Boy is revolutionized to the extreme! The Game Boy line now has thousands of titles and peripherals to choose from thanks to the new Game Boy Advance! (Failing record sound) Where is the extensive classic library and low priced peripherals? Nothing is low priced these days! Where are the innovative classics? On the top shelf at K-Mart. The GBA is a console out of reach for many and for others not intriguing enough. It is good for expanding your Game Boy selection and peripheral library but come on now. You need a light to play it in the dark but has non strenuous graphics. It is a good expansion but I really reccomend Sega Game Gear for classic seakers.

"Companion for a desert island: As a child we played Desert Island Castaways on rainy days when there was nothing to do. And we'd have to name 10 albums or books we'd take with us to a desert island and defend our choices. Pretty good test for a 7-year -old. I revived the game recently (40 years later) and this time, The Zodiac was on my list (along with Sailing to Philadelphia). This is music with all of life in one CD. It has allowed me to create at my best, and is a source of strength when times are not when they seem. My greatest joy is that I have had the privilege of seeing these musicians every year when I go to Venice. TO see them in their own setting is transporting. And to think of how few people have heard of them here in the US. Vivaldi would be pleased! I know you will be too.(Try the game, by the way...you can spend hours, have a great time and then, regroup with all the records and have an even better time.)

It is so cute and I feel better that she has a nightlight with no bulb to worry about. The star show on the ceiling and wall is gorgeous. She picks the color for the night - and it shuts off after 45 min - well after she has gone to bed. Love this - I highly recommend it!

"Scribbles and platitudes: There really isn't much to say about this book. It's cute and makes for nice eye candy. But it has more platitudes than suggestions and I wouldn't recommend it as a stand-alone. If you want a book that delves into creativity, check out Julia Cameron before she went completely commercial. This book might be a supplement to The Artist's Way, but otherwise it doesn't prove much except that you make gobs of money as a self-help guru without having to do much but scribble and spout trite phrases.

"After the first 3, the 4th is quite boring and redundant.: As the series progresses, more and more 'mysticism' becomes the driving force behind the book, thus getting further and further from an entertaining, perhaps educating, story.Also, the constant regurgitating of facts for a reader that has not read the previous ones wears thin.The series should have been 1 book--I think the author's profits or delusions of a 'saga' series ruined it.

"Bad Product: I got this product free with my purchase of my brand new DS Lite. First off, the instructions were not in English. However, I have used protective covers for my touch cell phone, so I understand how they work.There are 2 protectors inside and a nice cloth (love the cloth). Nowever, one protector is larger than the other one, so which one does it go on, I assumed the top so I started there. I applied it just like I did for my touch phone but these are super sticky. You get 1 try and that is it. Needless to say, I had so many bubbles that I carefully took it off and threw it out.I tried the bottom one, same results. There is no ""easy"" way to put these on and they seem to result in bubbles galore everytime.The bubbles are probably because they did not fit on just the screen, but overlapped on my DS which resulted in air underneath. If they had fit just the screen, maybe they would have been okay, but eh, doubtful.The cloth was nice. I kept it. Trashed the rest.

"A vast disappointment: There are a lot of things I did expect when starting that ""novel"". A plot was one of them, some of the famous Heller wit another (this book really is unfunny, but keeps winking at you as if you're just a tiny little bit away from getting some cosmic joke it really is about). I didn't expect to be treated to a 326 page long variation of Larry King's obnoxious observations in USA Today, set in ancient Greece and Holland of the 16th/17th century. The chronology is totally mucked up, it seems not because of some artitistic reason, but because it was cobbled together without any sense of structure.Finally, an author who seriously suggests that some of the dutch provinces are perhaps not even known to many INSIDE the Netherlands (hey Joe: this isn't the US you're writing about) doesn' instill too much confidence about getting his other facts right.One of the few books in my life I didn't finish (maybe the second half is a LOT better).

I was left thinking that the author accomplished little. the two stories by themselves are compelling and beautiful but are never resolved and never intertwine. they are linked only by a painting- created by a japanese woman that falls into the hands of a french man. his life is somewhat affected by it but overall- it's incomplete and the majesty of how one simple action can touch people on different sides of the world- is lost in a novel form. It's a poetic read but I cant say I enjoyed it. It wouldve been better off as seperate novellas

"Good Deal: These will cost you about ten dollars more a set at the local bike shop so unless you need pads now, I would suggest stocking up for the day when you have to replace. I run the Saint (BR-800) calipers but these are the exact same pads that are used by XTR/XT. Since Shimano makes these, I feel a little better using OE. The metallic do last a little longer than the resin, but I do get a bit more bite out of the resin and not as harsh of a braking sound (if you care about that). Currently I am doing a great deal of downhilling with the metallics and I can lock up the wheels if I need to without a ton of effort. These work, what more can you say?

I can understand that difficulties come up trying to create driver software that's compatible with someone else's operating system, but it appears they are choosing to ignore this problem and hope it passes with time. What's happened is that I no longer trust HP. I'm looking for a trustworthy machine if anyone knows a good manufacturer.

"Don't waste your time: This is by far Tartan's worst release. For a distributor that has brought us great titles as The Booth, the vengeance trilogy and else, this is scary at its lowest. The legend of the ghost is explained in other reviews, and it is quite interesting, to say the least. But this pseudo movie is not even that. Directed by a long-time contributor of B-movies (check his filmography), The Ghost of Mae Nak fails to be scary, is not stylish, and not even interesting. But it certainly is predictable, boring, lame, has the worst dialogues you'll hear in a long time, and it is plainly mediocre. Perhaps it is the style of the westerner director, he has shown that he likes/loves Thailand (Butterfly Man), but his skills as a director are not enough to create anything interesting.Watch Shutter, that one is truly creepy and is told by Thais who really understand Thai and know how to film. Don't waste your time with this dud.

The pictures are great (some are pretty gruesome, though) but what I really liked was learning about how the coroner solves cases, especially in the old days. They didn't have modern techniques like DNA and they had to rely more on witnesses and real investigation. Some of the cases were never solved, though, which is a shame because nowadays with all the high-tech stuff they probably would be.This is a very, very cool book that I would recommend to anyone interested in Hollywood history.

The best thing Rollins does, though, is write a chapter of FAQ'S at the end of each book, explaining how he developed his ideas and how much is based on real science or research.I don't know he churns them out so regularly, but I'm not complaining.

"Fun book: We borrowed this book from the local library. Initially we had to shine a flashlight on the pages to get the skeletons to glow, but then realized that just a few seconds next to the light bulb make each page glow brightly after the lights go out. My 4-year-old loves this book. There are pages on the skull, arm/hand bones, leg/foot bones, ribs and spine.

"A Big Disappointment!: I was looking forward to watching this movie with great anticipation, being a long-time Kubrick fan. What a huge disappointment! In brief, the movie was overly long, the plot disjointed and I never really felt much for Cruise or Kidman. It's too bad Kubrick's final movie had to be this one. Don't waste your time, rent or buy Clockwork Orange or Full Metal Jacket instead.

"more drivel designed to spread hatred and enrich Hal: Again, Mr. Lindsey writes a book that contains his vision of the end times psycho drama. This guy doesn't quit and for good reason. He's found a lucrative niche starting with ""Late, Great Planet Earth"". He adjusts his interpretation of scripture to fit his twisted view of the endtimes every few years and writes a new book.There is one constant and that is his ""everlasting hatred"" toward Muslims, and most particularly Palestinians. This stuff sells well as there is a large bloc of Christians who desperately need something to hate to sustain their faith. Skip this book and read the Bible yourself. Hal isn't a source for any truth.

Yes folks, it one of those ""it was just a dream"" films that we all hate. You know what im taking about.

"Nice Buds, but I like it louder!: First, I really dig the sound these ear buds put out. Second, they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever tried. No ear fatigue or soreness after 5 hours of mowing my lawn. Speaking of which I use a loud riding mower to mow and these noise canceling ear buds cut out the mower noise 95%. I love them. The only thing I would improve is MORE VOLUME! I love it loud and even though the noise cancelation helps most folks not need to turn the music up, I like volume. Great buds. Oh yeah, my first set became full of ear wax from mowing in the summer with them. The right ear bud became clogged. I sent them back and got a brand new set from Shure! They were awesome! But they did warn me to keep them clean as they would not send me another free set if I clogged them again. I think that's fair!

"rip off.: The opening riff of ""Even in Death"" is a direct rip-off of the riff in Rob Zombie's song on the Beavis and Butthead movie soundtrack (you know, the music to Beavis' trip in the desert). I don't mean it sounds kind of like it, I mean it IS it. Shame on you, Amy. Quit trying to sound like a cheap imitation of all the great female fronted bands from Europe and quit ripping other people off. If Evanescence is your introduction to this kind of music do yourself a favor and check out The Gathering, Within Temptation, After Forever, Beseech (incidentally, Evanescence's logo looks suspiciously similar to theirs), Amaran, Epica, Nightwish, Asrai, To-Mera, Theatre of Tragedy, Leaves' Eyes, Elis, Edenbridge, Drain STH, Collide, Tapping the Vein, Draconian, Stream of Passion, Ambeon, Ayreon... and that's just a start. Once you've heard all these bands I think you'll agree that Evanescence is only the tip of a much better iceberg.

"Good overview of breads in the world, not a good recipe book: This book starts with the usual 'bread book' introduction--explaining different grains, various methods of making bread,equipment etc. Then half of the book is devoted on introducing breads in different regions of the world. The rest is bread recipes from each part of the world.The pictures are nice and gives us an idea of what bread is in Germany, in France, in Japan, in the middle east. However, when I tried a couple of the recipes, they all turned out below average--and I am experienced in bread-making. I would suggest people who want to 'bake' to look somewhere else, such as 'the village baker'

"Awsome value!: I've had the TV about 3 weeks and so far it's been everything I'd hoped for. The picture, when the broadcast is in hi-def, is simply stunning. My first football game was the AFC championship game. My Pats not winning was the only downside(can't blame Sony for that). You could actually read some of the tattoos. Was wary of the rear projection technology-had heard about repair issues- but was assured by my tech competent son-in-law that Sony's SXRD was something new and better, not subject to repair problems of the past. So far, so good. At this point, couldn't be happier. Unless you want to hang it on the wall, why even consider spending the extra $500 for an LCD?

"Another Robert Flaherty work of art: The Bayou, Louisiana.This documentary is shot with a beautiful black & white photography. The music perfectly matches the tempo and feeling of the story. Lasts only 75 minutes but captures our emotion and interest right from the first scene.The box of the dvd misleads. It made me expect some kind of social reportage on the impact of oil industry in the pristine bayou wildlife. On the contrary (but that's for you to check).The story is basically the life of a young and enchanting kid in the Bayou. His daily occupations, his relation with surrounding nature (its enchants and perils). It provokes an emotion similar to the reading of Huckelberry's adventures.Again, as in all of Mr. Flaherty's documentaries, it's the sheer beauty of the photography and the wonderful capture of the expression of people's faces, real people, that make the viewing a humanly enriching experience.I have to recommend, also of Mr. Flaherty, ""The Man of Aran"" and ""Nanook of the North"".

"Returning it: I was looking for a caddy to keep in our master bedroom while our newborn is in with us so we didn't have to go change diapers in his room. Since I generally like Skip Hop products I thought this would be a good item. As soon as I opened it though I hated it. The caddy is made of hard plastic and is incredibly loud and heavy even when empty. The smallest movement makes everything rattle. The side pockets just slide on and move easily so it makes the whole thing just feel incredibly cheap and flimsy. The same for the drawers - just plastic sliding in plastic so it feels cheap. Despite how cheap it all feels, the cost (almost $40 at the time) is rediculous. I am returning and am getting a canvas one from JJ Cole.

"Better than AM radio: I took a chance buying this DVD, and it paid-off. I was never a big fan of Tommy James, but the songs are ingrained from years gone-bye (mostly AM Radio listening). What makes this DVD a special treat is hearing all these songs, for the first time, in premium sound quality. While I wouldn't rate the sound quality as superior -- it non-the-less delivers quality enough to make this DVD's 5.1 surround a keeper for the ages. The picture is also very good, and the setting, filmed at ""The Bitter End"" a small nightclub/bar makes the moment very personal. Much like some of my other favorites: Roy Orbison (Black & White), Bee Gees (One Night), Moody Blues (Royal Albert Hall), the overall quality and features (interview etc.)make this DVD one of those unique finds that favorably captures the music of its time in a just fashion. Chances are that if you show an interest in the DVD you will most likely enjoy it.

"Somewhere between Vonnegut and Eco: This is a very funny, strange, and thought-provoking book. Philip K. Dick's world is somewhere between those of Umberto Eco (there is a lot of theology here) and Kurt Vonnegut (surreal 1970s setting). The main character, with the unlikely name of Horselover Fat, is confronted with the fact that the universe is fundamentally irrational when a friend of his commits suicide. This flaw in the universe then proceeds to destroy Fat's sanity. He believes he has an encounter with god -- a perfect, gnostic god who exists outside of the flawed universe who has transmitted knowledge directly into his head by means of a pink laser.The ideal reader for this book should be a person who has studied theology at the college level, and who has an open mind. It is a very entertaining book with a lot of insight into our strange world, but it is by no means easy.

"Disappointed, but willing to try again: The title of the book interested me. I love quilting and I love history. I was also reassured by the quote on the cover that the books in the series could ""stand alone"", as I was unfamiliar with the author and all previous books. I had a very difficult time becoming interested in any of the characters, their lives and their problems. The seemed weak and lifeless to me. The language felt very stilted as well. I also noted very early in the book that scenes appeared that were, in some cases, almost word for word a copy of those found in Pride and Prejudice, both the book and the BBC mini series. It became almost laughable at points to compare the two. I would not recommend this particular book to anyone. I have been bolstered by the other fantastic reviews to give the other books in the series a try, but I'll visit the library to obtain them first.

"Tamilee Total Stretch: I purchased this DVD in May and have been using it faithfully for the past seven months. Let me just say that Tamilee is awesome! She is very encouraging, and does not have that typically annoying voice that most instructors have. She reminds you to do simple things that you may tend to forget such as proper breathing and posture. The DVD is composed of three 10 minute stretch routines: Standing, sitting, and a floor routine. And there is a 20-30 minute routine that focuses on all three areas along with a cool-down. I have acute cerebral palsy, so I was extremely inflexible with poor balance and range of motion as well as poor posture. Because of this video I am now much more flexible, my posture has improved as well as my balance. I can now do things I never thought I could before such as Tai Chi and kung fu. If this video can improve cerebral palsy, it can work for the most inflexible persons.

"Didn't last a month: Replaced our old heat tape with this brand about a month ago, when the old heat tape finally gave out after years of use, and the pipes froze.

The pipes froze again, and now we're having to take turns sitting out in the coldest weather of the season (we live on the Eastern Plains of Colorado), in the middle of the night, trying to thaw out the pipes.

"Caution! This book is simply Part II of Little Women: This is a great book, and my favorite part of Little Women. It covers the part when Jo goes to New York and meets Professor Bhaer. However, when I ordered ""Good Wives"" I thought it was a sequel that I hadn't read before. Instead I found that it was a poorly bound and poorly copied (e.g. faint print that's hard to read) copy of Part II of the book Little Women. If you have the novel Little Women you already have ""Good Wives."" I sat the books down side by side and compared them, and they are identical. I'm confused why everyone is referring to this as a sequel to Little Women, unless perhaps when Little Women first came out it ended when the father came home from the war, and maybe Part II was originally printed in a separate volume?However, every copy I've ever picked up of Little Women nowadays already has Part II in it, so if you have Little Women I'd advise you not to waste your money on this.

"Tripe.: This book was such a waste of time to read! I can't believe the library spent money buying it-but better them than me.The crimes imputed to Charlotte Bronte are nothing compared to those perpetrated by Mr. Tully in writing this book. He begins with a silly premise, and presents it badly. Granted, he is not a professional novelist. However,the absurd dialogue and plot development read like the work of a (not overly talented) high school student. If he has any derious knowledge of the Brontes' lives and work, little is betrayed in this trivial volume. According to an article in the BBC's online service, the author intended it as a work of nonfiction but the publisher would only accept it if he called it a novel.Perhaps the nonfiction approach would have been better, as Mr. Tully would have had to stick to the evidence of the alleged dirty doings at Haworth Parsonage. The book would in that case certainly have been shorter.Or beter yet, non-existant.

"I could have done without this one: I have been a Garth fan for a long time. I have just about all of his CD's, have seen him live, and look forward to his new releases. However, this one I could have done without. I think he is out of the groove or needs to create a new one. His work is drifting from the formula that made him a hit. This CD was very disappointing. There was nothing gripping about it. I particularly disliked Beer Run, an annoying song. I will keep it next to the Chris Gaines CD in my storage rack. Maybe it is time for Garth to retire for real, he seems to have lost some of his creativity and is a bit out of touch with the emotions that make a song memorable... like ""The Dance"". Maybe when the dust settles in his personal life and he matures more he will gain new insights that he will be able to put into words, or songs of his own again. Until then, I will definately listen before I buy!

"frustration and age, days and years.: This product helps bring out new skin cells at applied area. Maybe the hydrolyzed elastin and soluble collagen ripens and plumps the skin, at initial trial the affected area almost seems to ""crave"" or ""beg for"" more usage. It brings youth and tenderness to the applied skin area. However, the affected skin area increases in density (plump) and sometimes defines and increases the wrinkles while this product advertises to minimize them. All in all, this is somewhat effective. Smile like a baby!

"very pleased: the 100's of glowing reviews vs. the single digit bad reviews should sum up this product. I believe the reviewers who complained that a speaker didn't work hadn't connected them properly to the subwoofer, as I had at first. the plugs have a specific shape that will only fit one way- and if they aren't aligned, you won't get the second 'click' of a true connection. Once i discovered that, i've been enjoying this system endlessly. the sound for such a small unit is amazing. you can hear the bass outside the house on a fairly low setting. i'ts great for Dub and other deep, rolling music. The small speakers could be considered a little 'tinny' if you get right up to them, but when placed properly as a whole, the three speakers blend together and sound flawless. Hooked up to my Mac with no problems.great find, great price, get one while you can, i'm thinking about a second unit for the TV.

It is still an excellent toy for anyone into castles. I especially like the drawbridge and break away wall.

Instead, during the 3rd of 4 directed applications, my gums started burning and I stopped the process. More than 24 hours later, my gums, and more specifically the edges where my teeth meet my gums, are still irritated. Brushing my teeth last night was barely possible, as any contact with my gums created pain.

The music is recorded too low, probably out of deference to the performer's egos. They might as well be singing in the shower. ""Singing"" is a generous word here.

David Hamilton is one such giant. The Age of Innocence is a repository of some of the most startlingly-beautiful images the author has ever produced. While many are captured in Mr. Hamilton's classic misty surreal style, this volume concentrates on faces sharply etched and well-resolved.

"From Russia with Tedium: It is the year 2015, and a post-civil war Russia attempts to build a new democracy and discard centuries of Totalitarianism. Constantin Vadim, a militiaman from Murmansk, is assigned to Moscow as the chief homicide inspector of a destitute and war-torn district of Moscow to take charge of a brutal string of murders of young women by a fiend dubbed the ""monstrum"". For sure, an unusual and ambitious setting for a serial murder mystery, which historian Donald James tackles in ""Monstrum"". It is this ambition, however, that fatally flaws what could have been an intriguing novel; there are simply too many plots set in motion and too many messages that James is trying to deliver. Told by Vadim in first person, the all-too-frequent addresses to the reader as ""my brothers"" becomes tedious. While in the end most of these threads come together, payoff feels contrived, wholly implausible, and ultimately disappointing.

"More First Hand Accounts: I found this second volume of Farley Mowat's TOP OF THE WORLD TRILOGY even more readable that the first. This one deals almost exclusively with the efforts of people to get further and further north, culminating in attempts to reach the North Pole.What makes these accounts different from the others available is its reliance on presenting the stories in the words of the participants. Most of the reading is from the accounts of the explorers themselves. Mowat simply throws in an introduction, occasional comments for each narrative and an epilog for each venture.With this style of presentation, the story is of necessity selective. It does not purport to be a complete account of all polar ventures. It does, however, give a flavor of the times and the trials undertaken by those who lived them.This is a good read for those who are interested in the genre of exploration and adventure.

"Not for Coffee Snobs: This Cuisinart Supreme Grind is only slightly better than a blade grinder.The burrs are metal plates with blunt, not sharp, teeth for grinding. I am skeptical that the burrs are even steel. Another downside is that as it grinds a fine powder builds up in the corner of the container while larger grounds fall to the bottom; static is a problem, but ultimately it is easy to keep a tidy counter with this grinder.One positive feature is that one of the burrs is removable and therefore, I can have it modified and sharpened.Conclusion: spend $20-30 less and get a blade grinder or spend $30-40 more and get a good burr grinder.

"Risk management as an asset, not a cost: This is a book that every bank board member should read. Sure, any board member worth his/her salt will be familiar with Basel II and risk measures such as VaR, but how many think of Basel II as a cost or imposition, and VaR as just another piece of information? Mr Belmont's easy to follow approach should allow readers to examine the way in which they can differentiate their own institution by using the investment in regulatory risk management to create, rather than just protect,shareholder value.Thankfully, Mr Belmont strikes a good balance between theory and reality, both in his explanantion of market behaviour and in the presentation of his arguments.

I tried using the software that came with it, downloaded the upgrade of the software. Didn't sync well at all or it did partially.

"It's growing on me!: I loved ""Mud on the Tires"" so much I was a little disappointed when I first listened to this album. But over time, I'm really coming to appreciate it. I really enjoy the way Paisley writes music -- there's usually some surprise embedded in the song, whether it's in the words or the music. He doesn't go for the easy cliche' very often, which is something that bothers me about other country music.My favorite track on this album is ""Rainin' You' - he delivers it with such a personal, understated approach that I can really feel the bittersweet misery of the ""narrator."" I could do without ""Cornography,"" though! Replace it with another good, solid song!

"DEFINITELY not worth the money!: The ONLY song in here that is any good is Memory! The other ones are all right by themselves, but together they form a plotless, boring musical. I would NOT reccomend this to fans of musicals or cats (the animal). How so many people can think that this is such a great show is a mystery to me.

"Clock failed entirely after 60 days: Purchased Dynamic Living Oversized 16"" by 7.5"" digital LED calendar wall clock for my 92 year old mother March 20, 2012.

"You get what you pay for...: I was in the market for a cheap pair of headphones to use in the office, and was not expecting the crispest quality from these headphones. However, I did expect the item to last a little longer than 6 months... Within the first two months the cheap adjustable fitting band broke off, and now the cable connections are already starting to break down so I get intermittent sound in the right earpiece.These headphones were not subject to any extraorinarily harsh use either. They have remained hooked up to my computer from the moment I took them out of the package... They are either on my head or sitting on my desk. Simply put they're a poorly manufactured item that can't stand up to the most mundane uses.

"great for Yakitate!! Fans: Great album for all fans of the series. The ost contains all the background music, as well as first intro theme and the first two exit themes. The album totals 28 tracks. The best song, imo, is SOUL'd OUT's ""To All Tha Dreamers"" (this song as been stuck in my head since the first time i heard it). This is the extended version of the second exit song (the one where Manager is disco'ing). One of the more unique tracks is titled ""Japan #16"" fans of the series will remember this from Episode 2 during the pantasia preliminaries when Azuma created ""Mt. Fuji"". The track can be heard during Kuroyanagi's reaction to the bread. If your a fan of the series deffinatly pick it up one of the better ost's I've heard. JPop fans, you probably shouldn't pick the album up as there are only 3 actual songs on the album, the rest are musical selections from the series. So the price tag is quite hefty if your just looking for JPop.

"I was screaming ""Mistletoe!"" ten minutes into this film.: A lot of people told me that this was a terrible movie, but I really like Vince Vaughn and Reece Witherspoon, so I figured ""Four Christmases"" couldn't be THAT bad. Well, I was wrong. It is downright awful. Vince and Reece do the best job they can with a terrible script that reads more like a horror movie than a holiday comedy. There are a few humorous moments, but for the most part, I shuddered throughout the entire film, wondering what horrible things would happen to these poor people next. The one good thing about the movie is that it's super short, so if you do decide to be brave and watch it, you won't have to suffer for very long. However, I suggest steering clear of this one altogether.

Klass presents the evidence surrounding the Rosewell incident (and the non-evidence invented by the UFO-hucksters) and arrives at the only logical conclusion. The Rosewell ""crash"" involved a lot of coverup, and no aliens. This book serves as an excellent source for debating the credulous, and along with Kal K. Korff's ""The Rosewell UFO Crash : What they don't want you to know"" it buries the Rosewell Myth deeper than the Loch Ness. The Truth is Out There. And you can find it in this book.

"Vedder collaborates with choir of South African high schoolers.: Eddie Vedder brought a high school choir to Seattle to record an album of their music. This is not a Pearl Jam album. It is beautiful and inspiring. Vedder is not heard on all tracks, but does collaborate with the choir on three excellent Pearl Jam songs. ""Long Road"", ""Love Boat Captain"", and ""Betterman"" all gain new emotional depth with the additional backing of the Walmer High School Choir. The booklet contains a great essay by Eddie Vedder about the making of this album. The traditional South African music is wonderful, and it is great that it was recorded.""Music has been a fundamental weapon for our children used to face all the trials of this world. In our culture, listening to the words of a song is why they resist, why they don't crack""- Lunga Dyani, Principal of Walmer High School

"Avoid this flimsy thing!: The concept of a futon mattress atop slats is actually comfortable and I lay on it for a week happily until I made the mistake of putting too much focused pressure and snapped/broke two of the very fragile slats by climbing onto it with my knee first. Also, I called the manufacturer on the first day to tell them that the filling inside the cushion covers was making me itch. These are not cushions with a black cover. This is a black cover filled with recycled fabric pulp. The rep was not interested in responding to my complaint. Don't buy this. Go to a futon store and buy something that resembles this and it will be much sturdier.

"A Forgotten Gem: Recordings of ""La Traviata"" are never in short supply and this recording has been somewhat ""lost in the shuffle"". There is much to recommend it - first and foremost, the rarely recorded artistry of the late Pilar Lorengar. Though her fluttery vibrato may put some listeners off (as well as some odd Italian pronunciation), her fragile interpretation takes a fresh look at Verdi's tragic courtesan. Giacomo Aragall was at his peak at this point in his career. Lorin Maazel conducts the score with great sensitivity. The big drawback: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is dreadfully miscast as Germont. He sings wonderfully but his interpretation of the role is too severe without the change of heart which makes this character so very human. Perhaps this is not the first choice for a ""Traviata"" recording but you could do a lot worse.

"Red Hot Chilis go cold.: The Red Hot Chili Peppers are juet getting too old to pull off the ""young punks"" act anymore.

This reminds me a lot of the 1980's albums that The Stones and other bands put out: one or two good songs, mainly a lot of dull filler.

One time I was busy and I became aware it was hot when I smelled burning plastic. I contacted the manufacturer who essentially noted the instructions say to stand and watch it. Why bother with the whistle then? No whistle would actually be safer because you'd know it wouldn't whistle. It has some nice design features and some poor design features and looks great, but you can get a nice looking tea kettle that will serve you better for half the price. It will last much longer too because you won't burn it up.

"If you think that yoga is just for passive meditation you are wrong: For some reason yoga has been presentated to those of us who live in the west as a passive and meditative activity only. Yoga is really a science that allows you to tap into the unlimited creative powers of your subconscious mind and is capable of building great physical strength and a powerful physique. The yoga monk Bodhidharma taught the principles of yoga to the Shaolin Monks centuries ago and converted them from a weak group of passive meditators to the legendary warriors that they eventually became. Dr. Young was a pioneer in teaching the potential of yoga to develop real world strength that is applicable to all parts of your life and not just a relaxing passive applicaton. This is a great book.

"The Best Book on a political race ever.: This is a great read if you're into politics. An amazing love story too. Following the presidential primaries and general election of '92 from two different perspectives that seamlessly entertwine. You hear about Clinton pick Gore for Vice President and walking out of the Arkansas Governors Mansion all youthful and with kids. And then Mary's political reaction to that scene and how it affects President Bush's race who is being perceived at the time as out of touch. Priceless anecdotes. Very fast as campaigns just chew up time and people's lives. Civility too, such as it was, in the political realm of those days. I ordered this book because I was attending a lecture with the authors. I was lucky enough to talk to them and get this signed. Their insight today is right on and hysterical. Great Book. Catch them if they are giving a lecture.

The general focus on the mystery of electricity, its many expressions and the history of discovery is interesting. However ... some of the essays are weakly researched and written. The author inserts nonsequitors and irrelevant comments, as if no editor reviewed the work. The scientific explanations are adequate, but not insightful. The flow through history is tenuous. There are better works of science, history and biography in this area.

"Impressive Electro-pop: ""Pop Robot"" is a very strong album from Empire State Human. Given its price and the fact that the CD has twenty-one tracks, it's also an excellent value, doubly so in that the CD does not become tiresome with repeated listens. It stays fresh and interesting, and is definitely one of the best synthpop albums I've bought in a while. Fans of synthpop will recognize a range of influences on ""Pop Robot,"" like Kraftwerk and early Human League, but the album does not sound at all dated. Some of my favorite songs are Paralyzed, I Work for the Government, Eastern Lights and Apollo. I would definitely recommend this CD to any fan of electro-pop.

"A Real treat!: If you can take it, you will really like this book. Unlike some other reviewers, I found the humor in the book to be edgy and refreshing, though not for the squeamish--its like someone's unconscious run amok. The writing is very free-wheeling and free-flowing, which really makes you feel as if you are in the main character's head. And speaking of the main character, I think some of the ""unpleasantness"" in the book occurs because the narrator strives to be as open as possible, so he talks about every single impulse and feeling he has, some of which are quite funny, some quite sad, and some just unpleasant. Still, I think the book gives a rare glimpse into the mind and heart of someone who is struggling with life and love, and even if you don't like all the characters all the time, many of us, whether we care to admit it or not, can identify with what is going on. I certainly could!

She's a feisty one and the guy for her...well...only Linda knows. P/S: Does Linda have other fans in Malaysia? Get in touch...I'd love to hear from you.

"Please wake me when the film is over: At the end of The Sweet Hereafter, I had tears in my eyes- tears of boredom. I would like to use this forum to point out the parts of the film that annoyed me. First of all, the incest scene is ridiculous. The young girl is not raped by her father, rather, they make love together. Candles? Why? It was like a scene out of a cheap romance novel. That scene actually made incest look sweet. The father looked like he was his daughter's age! Second, did anyone else notice that the bus driver had a Minnesotan accent while she drove the bus, but not any other time in the movie? Did the director forget about that? The book is a lot better than the movie, and the book isn't that great. The lawyer in the book is much more energetic, the incest is what it should be, dirty and immoral, and the scenes were drawn out way too much in the movie. Of course, what do I know?

"Roger Morris' Fiasco: The title and pictorial representation leads one to believe that the book would share some light on the past and present exploits of the Clinton's political arranegements. However the book is in fact a catalog of ramblings about unsubstantiated charges of corruption at all levels of government. Additionally an inordinate portion of the text is dedicated to the struggles the Clintons went through in their early lives. It also goes off on tangents that only remotely relate to the Clinton's felonious life style. To the interested student of power brokers this book is replete with redundancies that leads to a boring and sophomoric exercise.

The story is about a girl who is forced to spin straw into gold in only one night. She get`s help from the ""little mysterious ugly"" man who suddenly appear in front of her. She has to make him some promises, then he would spin the straw into gold for her.Kathleen Turner tells the story very well, but the best is though Tangerine Dreams music who completes the story. There is an instrumental piece at the end of this cd.""rumpelstiltskin theme"" wich is the original music without the fairytale. Have a cup of warm chocolate in front of the fireplace, and listen to the straw that is been spinning to gold...whoosj...whoosj.. :-)

The makers of this remake threw in a bunch of unneed material(like the hotel junk,the women trying to seduce Dennis Quaid,the brief camping trip etc!) As for the DVD , it lacks extra features such as commentary from cast,director,behind the camera,production notes etc!

Also Disney when are you going to release the orginal ""Parent Trap"" on DVD? also Disney start improveing your DVD's and bring the consumers the extra features we desire on this great new format that kicks VHS big time!

"As I Lay Dying--Critical Edition: Faulkner is not for everyone, I think anyone who has ever read a single page of his writing canagree to that. Stream of consciousness dictates to the point of distraction, characters contradictthemselves, and you almost break out in a sweat as atmospherically he's nothing but pure Mississippi.But, he's fascinating with his use of language, and, amazingly, his stories moveforward. The trials and heartache involved in seeking to transport Addie Bundren to her desiredresting place in death are so haunting that the book is nearly impossible to forget.The newly released Norton Critical Edition is a great help in putting it all together.There are explanatory footnotes included in the text, along with a fine introduction and criticalessays at the back.

"Best book ever! Trust me!: Here is an intense mind blowing look at our times. Marc travels the world in search of the past glories of red light districts of famous cities. Some are intact and thriving, most are sanitized with Gulliani precision. Absolutely funny discriptions of Paris sex clubs,Vegas feeding frenzies, and everything L.A. I'm definitely headed for Hunter's bar in West Hollywood,7511 Santa Monica Blvd. Leslie Jordan mentions Hunter's in his Pink Carpet book. Must be the coolest place on the planet. Lookin' forward to 20 inches of hot dogs to coat my throat. Also contained, a marvelously loving insight into modern day Russia(worthy of a film).

"Good idea - Poor quality control: I purchased this as a gift. The first time it was used, the CD drive worked once for a few minutes and never worked again. It would just keep searching for a CD and never find it. We tried new music CDs right out of the package, MP3 CDs, older music CDs and nothing worked. It wouldn't recognize that we had a CD.I returned the first one thinking that any product has a few defects in it. Got the replacement and it was worse, if possible. It never worked at all.To be fair, the tape and the radio parts of the unit worked fine, but the CD part (which is what we really wanted) never worked at all. I have purchased many CD players before and never had one that didn't work. It's not that difficult a product to produce. This product is obviously not manufactured with any kind of quality control.I would NOT recommend this item to anyone. Perhaps we may have gotten a good unit if we had tried again, but for me, two defective units in a row is too much.

"It's about time!: This is the first paranormal romance I've read in *years* that doesn't suffer from poor writing, weak plotting or a lack of editing. Yes, the story is one that we've seen many twists on before (tortured hero falls in love with heroine despite both of their best intentions) but I have to say, this is GOOD and God knows I'm picky.I had minor nitpicks with the plot, but I liked the characters, dialogue and overall style and quality so much that it didn't really matter. I went through this in one sitting and can hardly wait until March for the next installment. The top authors in this genre (Christine Feehan, Sherilyn Kenyon etc) need to start punching up their work - J.R. Ward's work is definitely a contender for the top of the besteller lists.

We tried quite a few different bottles but these seemed to be the best all around. Our daughter has never had any issues with them and cleaning them is quite easy (contrary to some reviews I have read). There are pipe cleaners and such included with the bottles that are handy. I happen to boil the nipples and the plastic rings after cleaning them just to make sure I got everything, but what parent isn't over cautious. On a side note, some people have complained about hiccups. Our pediatrician and many books have assured us that babies couldn't care less about them and that the most likely cause is that the baby isn't getting a tight enough seal around the nipple with his/her lips.

I figured the good guys would end up winning out in the end and maybe the ending would be okay, but by the time I stopped the movie, I just didn't care and wanted to watch something else.Bottom line, if you love plotless movies, violence and nudity, go for it.

I laughed once at the humor; the other attempts at humor were pretty ""lame"" as is the writing. It got old really fast that the lead character would seem to be saying something, only to have the quote followed up with how that's what she was thinking, she really said... And what she actually said was something spineless. Jaine Austen (what a dreadful name; is it supposed to be clever?) is not a character to particularly admire.2.

You aren't just learning how to negotiate the price of a car, or just good negotiation skills - you are really learning the auto sales business and techniques, as well as reinventing the way in which to purchase a new car. Following Mr. Bragg's advice (especially the ""Fax Attack"" method) you really do become the cat instead of the mouse. You do NOT need to walk into a dealership and negotiate price. Use the Fax Attack method and just wait for dealers to call with quotes; field the lowest offers, and start them on a bidding war against each other!

"Presumptions Falter: The depiction of the contemporary cultural functionality of poetry here is rather oversimplified. The domesticated modernity of Eliot and his neo-symbolist reactionary Romantics on one side, the ""academic"" obscurantism on the other: this dichotomy presumes that 1) one is less amenable to the often redoubtable motives of academia; 2) there is some edenic endgame wherein poetry becomes a representative art (a weird nationalism, really); 3) most importantly, that neither tendency, even in these generalized formulations, is currently doing cultural work. If by ""cultural work"" we mean generating cultural moments and effectively shaping that culture, I can't see how the synchronic angle signaled by the first word in the book's title (and exploited as though a comfortable given throughout the argument) has any sway itself. Ultimately, the book is as defeatist for me as it is a rallying cry for others.

Lousy instructionmanual, not clear at all on the sequence ofassembly; had to unbolt it a number of timesin order to get it to fit correctly becauseof the way the wheels have to be bolted on.The next one, IF there is a NEXT one, shouldbe a lot easier to assemble since I now knowwhat to allow for in advance. I can say thishowever,it does appear to do the job quite welland with the free S&H; and ESPECIALLY it beingMADE IN THE USA !!!!!!! Kudos for that HTC !!

"JUNK-IT: After two years of a fair amount of use, my oven stopped baking and broiling. The toaster still functions,(big deal). Afer reading other customer's reviews, it seems that this oven is of such poor quality that the Black and Decker company should hang their heads in shame. Never again.

"Best of the best...: It's not my favorite expansion but it is very fun throwing parties. I found this expansion to be the most ""social"" than any other expantion, besides Sims Hot Date (Which is my favorite expansion.) Whenever your Sim is socialy deprived you can easily throw a party. There are also More than 80 new objects, including a dance cage, mechanical bull, etc. Also there is new characters, costumes, and music. This game is a must buy and will expand it a lot.

"Just love it. The best portable device ever owned: I watch a ton of movies with it. I had them rented from blockbuster. The player only reads wmv video but I converted all the movies using Crazi Video for PMC. I was able to watch them on the long usually boring bus ride. The player has 20GB that was enough to fit 12 movies. It is also light weight and very stylish.The movies have a very clear picture quality and Great sound quality.

"4 1/2 stars for Australian crime thriller: Set in suburban Melbourne, we meet a low life crime family consisting of 3 dimwit brothers, their best friend, their mother hen and ultimately their nephew. Kind of a cross between the family in ""The Fighter"" and ""Goodfellas"". For the most part these armed robbers are successfully dodging the police until corruption within the department causes death and reprisals. The movie is a crime thriller of the first order with young J., the nephew, getting caught in the middle. Great performances including Oscar worthy Jacki Weaver as ""Mum"" Cody. The film has none of the Hollywood money, so has no car chases or unnecessary shootouts. It's violent but is real rather than an explosion of blood splattering. I struggled with the slang Aussie English at times, so flipped on the subtitles. It helped to understand what the words were, but I'm not sure what some of them meant.

"Vapid: There are too many loose ends in this book to make is a satisfying read for an adult. Personally, I found it vapid and wouldn't give it to a child because it lacks the kind of depth one would want to develop in a tween. Although I've read many good reviews of this book, I'm afraid it seems like a re-run of so many other stories

"I love my Kindle!: I know others have said the same thing, but I am just mesmorized by my Kindle. I had to gulp at the price and the idea of spending more on books, but after reviewing the discussion boards (thanks everyone!) I have gained a huge amount of knowledge and have free books from Feedbook.com (all classics) and learned how to check my hotmail on it! I have had it for about six weeks now.I cruise through Amazon selections and have added many samples. This is probably one of the top features on the device. I have read many and I would not have liked the entire book which really has saved me money as well. I have ALOT of books around my house that I have started but not finished or even looked at in years. I find I am reading more than before and that is what I wanted to do. I seem to be able to find the time now, imagine that!I hope they get back in stock for all who want to receive and you can enjoy it as much I am.

"EXCELLENT!: One of Sheila Klass's latest masterpieces ""The Uncivil War"" gives a description of a girl named Asa who is fighting two wars, one against her mother and the other against her classmate Robert Lee. And as if thats not enough her younger brother is born very premature. Sheila Klass gives a vivid description of Asa's class and her friends. And even the charachters like Asa's friend Felicia have stories tied to them. I reccomend this book to kids who are looking for an enjoyable, funny and enthralling book.

"Eminem Filler (With Very Little of Eminem): It's great to see that Eminem holds it down for the guys he came up with, especially since they are holding him back and lack serious talent. Now there are a few funny tracks (Em's verse of `Get My Gun') and D12 does what it didn't do on its debut release: get serious. And when they do the Dirty Dozen actually produces pretty solid tracks with `How Come' and `Good Die Young'. However, Eminem is barely featured on the CD (unlike `Devil's Night') and that leaves the other five members to struggle their way through a full-length album. Though members like Proof and Kuniva have some talent on the mic, the CD is a disappointment and D12 continues to prove to be filler for hardcore Eminem fans.(2/5 mics)

"a band you can believe in: this is my favorite seattle band, and one of my favorites, full-stop. i saw them play a local show, and i remember thinking ""i don't know exactly what the hell that was, but it was amazing and i love it"". i went right over and bought their cd and the band signed it.i can't tell you how many times i've listened to this album- the songs are very creative/original while still being very enjoyable to listen to. i recommend this cd to anyone, but especially to anyone like me when i first heard them, was not hearing anything exciting in the music industry, you can get excited about this band- cool people, great songs, and tons of talent. Lead singer Ryann is a classicaly trained vocalist in a rock band, the result is absolutely amazing- you'll love it.

"Shrek in black and white?: The player displayed no color (black and white only) when it arrived. Apparently that is a common problem with this particular model.

This did not cure the problem, and therefore the player was promptly returned.

"Forgotten Eastwood film that also stars George Kennedy: Simple plot but a nice change of pace considering his path of Westerns and soon to be string of Dirty Harry cop films, Eastwood is every bit his own man in this mountain climbing adventure. The film is based on a novel by Trevanian, and surrounds the story of a man sent with 3 other climbers. He is blackmailed to execute one of them while climbing with them in the Swiss Alps. Stormy weather, icy conditions and that brutal devil called gravity also prove not to be Jonathan Hemlock's friend. Eastwood plays the part of Hemlock and does so quite convincingly, but not only that this is a gem in which it was also directed by Eastwood himself! The drama that unfolds on the climb in the alps is nothing short of spectacular, and this is definitely a must see for Eastwood fans of a younger generation of his films that might have missed it the first time.

"Extremely informative and engaging: Kathleen Hall Jamieson is very, very smart, and very good at challenging conventional wisdom. In this book, she demolishes most of the tried-and-thought-true assumptions about politics, usually taking a more optimistic tack. The thrust of her argument is first, that the American public is not becoming less politically capable (for the most part), and second, that the media pursues its own agenda and distorts the news more than we like to admit. She makes both of these points in a somewhat messy manner, because her topics are all over the place, but it's hard to disagree with her at the end.

The Smurfs pictured were in terrible condition(missing parts, chipped paint), and the book does not have a comprehensive listing or illustration of all of the Smurfs available. The next book about Smurfs by this author does have far more pictures of Smurf figurines, but the identifications under the pictures are confusing and hard to read. Additionally, the pictures of the individual figurines are tiny, almost too small to be useful for a quick reference. At least the figurines pictured are in better condition than the ones in the first book.

"Quite a surprise - in a good way: I was expecting this film to be horrible - the critcs apparently hated it - it was considered a failure at the box office, bad word of mouth, etc.Instead - what a fascinating concept and cleverly executed. Much has been made of ""clones"" in the press lately - most people do not realize that technology now does not just make a duplicate ""Dolly"" - no, Dolly has to grow up - from fetal development onward. Just what does that mean for the human clone? - Just what do you do with what is left - when the liver, eyes, kidneys, heart etc are removed? -- This film attempts to answer those questions - and believe me - given the naked greed our pharmaceutical and medical industry exhibits - I do not believe this film was far off on what may really happen if technology ever permits.Excellent action adventure - with many haunting questions - I recommend this film.

"Great for three chapters...: This is the best grad quantum book I have read so far. The first three chapters (Fundamental Concepts, Quantum Dynamics, and Angular Momentum) of the book are wonderfully done. These chapters, I believe, were completed by Sakurai before his untimely passing. The rest of the book seems to lack Sakurai's clarity but it does an adequate job tackling this difficult subject. Whether the lack of clarity is due to the increasing difficulty of the subject matter or the fact Sakurai didn't write it is unclear to me. After going through the whole book I only disliked the presentation of chapters four and six (Symmetry and Identical particles). These chapters were less mathematical and were more theoretical and could have used Sakurai's magic touch. The book was a great resource for a grad quantum class.

"Big Disappointment: I was utterly disappointed about this movie and turned it off 23 minutes into it. As mentioned, the visual and audio quality is horrible, but on top of that the cover picture of a commercial airliner leads customers to believe this is a disaster movie about a commercial jet airliner going down with a couple of hundred passengers on board, and the rescue and investigation efforts after the event, instead, this is a military film with no suspense build-up whatsoever. So in addition of the misleading cover picture (""false advertisement?""), this movie is beyond boring - it's a waste of money and resources.

"Boiler Plate Consultant Material: Business continuity planning needs to be tailored to the organization and its needs. This book does not present a methodology which can be tailored as such.

Basic stuff and not particularly useful.

"Incredibly stupid: That has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Although the cinematography is wonderful and the retelling of Siddartha's story is, at times, interesting, the part of the film that takes place in modern times is simply awful. The characters are either boring or painfully inconsistent; The boredom of Fonda in this role is surpassed only by the tedium of Chris Isaak. And,from what I could take from the picture, the future Lama has decided to reincarnate himself into three selfish yet English speaking children. What a disappointment, particularly from Bertolucci. I could not believe this was from the man who gave us The Last Emperor.

"From a Matt Good fan...: I'm not going to waste my time reviewing the album's content. I just want to give you all one piece of advice: buy the Canadian copy of this album.

Also included are a couple of songs that weren't even released on this album, but other albums.

"Not enough of what we want to know: Having been a fan of John's music for over 20 years, I expected more from his autobiography, then what I got.It was interesting reading, and his honesty was refreshing; however, I was looking for more in depth writing on the various songs he had written.Few of them were written about it any detail.His second marriage to Cassandra Delaney was glossed over, in my opinion, as was his relationship with his children.I suppose it is hard to cram one's life into a 200 page book, but then again a marriage and children would seem to be more important than EST training.Still, overall, a decent read.I remain a fan of the man and his music. May he rest in peace.

"Just be aware, 2G is NOT 2GB: This is a nice enough product, but it is for a second generation shuffle which is not even sold any more. If you were to order the Package deal with the puck, the Ipod, and the arm band, the shuffle you would get (4th generation, look at the picture) would not fit the holder in the puck you would get with it. Mea Culpa for not checking more closely but there are so few products out there for my shuffle that I leapt before I looked. If you DO have an older Ipod shuffle 2G (not 2GB, 4th Gen) this will probably work fine for you , just be aware and avoid the return hassle. (to be fair it wasn't much of a hassle.

"lackluster sketches, interesting writing: There are vintage Bourgeois books that justify the inflated pricetag: ""Memory and Architecture"", for example.But looking through ""Drawings and Observations,"" it is hard to find any visual to indicate that the artist is an inspiring genius. In fact, the works range from juiceless mediocrity to cartoony. They're like the level that most artists would toss.The only redeeming value I can see is psychological insight - just in case her truly fine work doesn't do the job for you.The writing, on the other hand, has tremendous value on how this artist thinks as she creates.All of her work seems to have depth of thought behind it. Art students would benefit from reading this book. And the sketches, even though they are of no significance aesthetically, are important as illustrations in tandem with the writing.NOTE: It's heartening that, at this point, the price has come down so that it is now affordable for art schools and students.

"0 STARS: This movie is a loser.: ""Strangeland"" is one of those dime a dozen movies that employs torture scenes that are meant to disturb the viewer. There is nothing suspenseful or scary about it. There is no atmosphere, and the story is lame and so is the script. There really isn't much of plot, and the villain in unconvincing in his over the top role. I was very disappointed in this trash. This movie is so stupid, and I guess that's one of the reasons people like it because it's so bad that it's funny, but those types of movies just do not interest me. You can have all the torture, pain and suffering that you want, but unless you have a good story, decent acting, atmosphere and suspense, you are not going to have a good horror movie. And, ""Strangeland"" is not exception to that rule; it's a total loser. And, on one final note, I must say that the guy with those piercings scares me about as much as that kid on the ""Wonder Years"". What a joke! LOL!

First of all, there really was no better way to end thie series and second, I was too happy to care. The plot of Lain has always been secondary. The primary goal of the series' creators was to make us love Lain as a person. I almost felt like I knew Lain by the end, and I feel that the creators suceeded masterfully in their goal. You know enough. See Lain. If you have seen it, see it again.

His message gets lost in these elongated thoughts, elaborate case histories that are overdrwwn as if he intends a shore story.

"Not thorough, and inaccurate: Chris Nickson seems to supplement his income as a music critic in Seattle by researching and writing unauthorized biographies about stars such as Melissa Etheridge, Mariah Carey, and Soundgarden. The problem is, none of the research is original at all....his entire book is swiped, without attribution, from already published interviews. There is not a single thing in this book that fans don't already know, and Joyce Luck's Melissa biography (which was also unauthorized, though I hear Melissa and her management liked the book) at least had some new, previously unpublished info and photos in it. Plus Nickson's book is just riddled with errors (for example, it says John Shanks was with the band during the Never Enough tour, which is totally false). One good thing about Nickson is that he at least doesn't have a problem with Melissa's lesbianism. Other than that I'd say his book's a total flop.

"""This is not rock!"": The only reason this album deserves 1 star is because of two reasons! I couldn't give it a half star and only two songs on this album keep me from burning it! Whatever Ben Folds Five think they are doing, it is not music.First of all, Ben Folds cannot sing worth a flip. The only song that he shows even a smudge of talent is ""Brick.""

This song is just fun thats the only reason I like it. Ben still can't sing on this one but the words make it fun. Other than that, songs like ""Fair"" ""Song for the Dumped"" and ""Smoke"" really make this album the piece of crap that it is. Ofcourse, ""Brick"" will make this one sell.

"Been Tricked: After reading a review of the Nitro PDF converter I thought I would give it a try. Like many software companies, Nitro offers a free trial. For several reasons (not the point of this review) I determined not to make the purchase.

I've tried various forms of uninstall including uninstalling and reinstalling Acrobat. It's still there. To date, Nitro has not reponded to my requests for help. In my opinion, this is dirty and unethical self promotion at the trial user's expense. I suggest you don't try Nitro unless you are certain you want to buy it.

Third, I wish there was a wrist strap so when you get off your bike to run, you could take it with you instead of having to switch to something else.Considering all the factors, I'm glad I got the Garmin Edge...maybe I shouldhave gotten the Garmin Edge 305!!

"Song of the Night: Despite a performance timing of 100 minutes (it has been reported that Mahler took 74 minutes), this and the Horenstein performance are the only ones to really reach the character of this work.Horenstein's might well be the way Mahler played it. Even so, this is my favorite. To quote another reviewer, it makes the others (except Horenstein) fast and superficial.The Klemperer compositions are wonderful.This should be reissued.

"There's nothing new here: I usually read the back cover of a book before I purchase it. However, in the lone exception of James Patterson I refrain from doing that because he always entertains with something new and original and I don't want to ruin the surprise; That is until ""Cradle and All."" I read this book almost ten years ago. Patterson wrote ""Virgin"" in 1980. Same plot, same locations, some derivations from the original. Save your money and get ""Virgin"" from the public library. No more blind faith for me... sorry Mr. Patterson, in the future, I'll review the story and determine if it's something new, before I take out my credit card.

It arrived with one of the box all taped up, don't know who did the taping, Amazon or Fed EX. There are 7 separate parts in the box, well a complete box, that is. My taped up box had 2 parts inside and 5 missing ones. Impossible to use in this condition. Amazon is fantastic and continue to amaze me with their shipping prowess. They did not hesitate at all, sent me a ups pickup shipping label for the defective unit and immediately sent me a new one. This one arrived with the box mostly intact and all the parts inside. Thanks Amazon, but who didn't notice about 10 pounds missing from the first box?Oh, I did put it to use and it does help stabilize the front of the 5th wheel.

Armenians have resided in modern land of Armenia and ancient Armenia, which covered the land from all of Turkey to Azerbaijan, for thousands of years!

We even have our unique blood, traditions, culture, music, and foods that NO OTHER RACE on this planet, HAS or HAD in the past.

"The Best Of The Early Days: December's Children was released in 1966, it was The Rolling Stones fifth album. With this new 2002 remastered version on ABCKO the sound is superior compared to the 1986 version on CD.

"Powerful: Walt Kowalski is a Korean war vet and a retired auto worker. He has lost his wife and has seen his neighborhood deteriorate. He lashes out with hatred and contempt at everyone around him. Underneath all of this though is a man with high morals and a real sense of what's right and wrong. This is easily the most powerful acting performance of Clint Eastwood's career. He was snubbed for the Oscars, but no matter. This is the performance of a lifetime, even outdistancing his role in ""Million Dollar Baby"". Eastwood also produces and directs this drama that takes us deep inside Walt Kowalski's soul. The ending is an absolute shocker too. Rumor has it that this is Eastwood's final film as an actor. If this is so, then he has saved his best for last. It is the partial ending (hopefully he will continue to produce and direct) of the career of one of America's greatest film makers.

"VERY POOR JARDINE SERVICE: We bought the entire Jardine Olympia, Lifetime crib and dresser/toy box set. We loved the looks of the furniture, but the quality is quite poor. The finish on the changing table / dresser is already coming off. Where we change our baby (who is only 3 months old), the whole front of the dresser is chipping!! I can't believe it! I contacted the manufacturer, and they said the finish is not warrantied. They're not standing by their furniture. Also, the drawers, as several people have already said, are not quality made. They are difficult to open, and they shift when closing. The tracks are poorly constructed. The one good thing I have to say is the looks of the furniture is absolutely beautiful.....UNTIL YOU USE IT! It wears quickly! We expected to keep this furniture nice for a while, considering how much we paid for the set. I would never go Jardine again after dealing with them directly, and having no luck.

I did not open the shrink wrap but on inspecting it from the outside, I saw quite a few edges that looked rough and easy enough to get splinters from while playing. There were a couple of places that the product was already nicked. Unfortunately, this is on the front side of the castle. So I'm hoping I can exchange this for another piece instead and fewer issues. There was also something rattling and I'm not sure if it comes with any loose pieces.That said, the castle is well made.

That could be because there is a ressistance line just above the neckline that restrict price advance causing it to decline, that failuer has nothing to do with the Head and shoulder formation. so you get wothless statisticsThere is one free web site that shows all support and ressistance lines and gives buy/sell recomendation.

"Laugh out loud funny: When Bill Bryson was in his twenties he went on a trip to Europe. It was for him a liberating experiance despite spending his time with a friend called Katz.This book is about another trip that he goes on through Europe after he has worked in England for some years as a journalist. He starts of in Norway and travels through Europe to Istanbul.Bryson is partially a travel writer, partially a story teller. His books are largely a starting point to have a talk. That can be about his childhood, his German teacher or his belief in the arrogance of French people. This book is actually a laugh out loud type of book.

The singers were AWFUL and for some reason sang in a really bad, forced grummble-voice. They mispronounced lots of words and I think they didn't even get some of them right at all, although I won't listen to it again to find out. They didn't sound like they even understood the words. There was not one song on the album that was any good, everything was done bad, some worse than others... Zwitter comes to mind as one of the worst. Not even the new music was any good on its own.

Basically, this is a collection of letters that the author wrote to a bookshop in London ... over the course of several decades. The bookshop helped to feed her reading habit, and the unusual correspondence cemented a unique bond between the two parties. The book starts off a bit slow, but very quickly you'll become engrossed in this wonderful postal relationship. Funny and moving.

"Entering my 2nd childhood!: In a fit of nostalgia, I decided that I HAD to get an Etch-A-Sketch, preferably one as close as possible to my original Etch-A-Sketch. While the lines on the screen appear to be lighter than the original, I'm still very pleased to own this. It often keeps me busy while I'm watching television, and I hope to introduce my great-nephew to this in the near future. A little pricier than I remembered, but still worth the price tag.

"Solid cast of characters, offbeat setting, good crime story: This was my first venture into the Scottish police procedural, though I guess there are quite a few titles out there if the category has its own name: ""Tartan noir"". In any event, I enjoyed the tough but likable law enforcement officers of Aberdeen, Scotland and the creepy yet engaging crime story in which they move about. ""Cold Granite"" also benefits from interesting supporting characters, including an ambitious reporter who keeps getting in the way of the police investigation yet still sort of becomes friends with the central invesitigator, Detective Sergeant Logan MacRae. There's even the occasional romantic scene, between Logan and one of his female officers, to lighten up the dark story from time to time (though the scenes don't so much as depict a romance as Logan's desire for one). I liked the energy and vibrant images of ""Cold Granite"", as well as its easy readibility. I'll be sure to look for Stuart MacBride's second offering.

"poor quality product: I have two PRECIOUS great danes, 7 and 10 years old. Cod liver oil has been great for them, but it is expensive. I thought this time I'd try this brand since it was so much cheaper and it said it was 100% Norwegian, which I've heard is the best. The pure Cod Liver Oil I had been getting smelled fishy (was unflavored Nordic Naturals ""Pet Cod Liver Oil"") which I would assume is how all REAL cod liver oil smells, but this stuff smells like castor oil, and when you refrigerate it, it becomes a semi solid which you have to wiggle out with a butter knife. The kind we are used to, the Nordic Naturals, needs to be refrigerated too, and unlike this product, it pours out smoothly and retains its consistency...and it smells good and fishy like my precious angels like it!

"Annoying in more ways than one: My daughter got this for her first birthday. She adores phones, but this one goes to the bottom of the toy pile. The cord is way too short. When she tries to put it next to her ears, the phone comes off the ground and hits her. The noise the phone makes is also very annoying. If I forget to turn off the sound, it will continue talking from the bottom of the toy box long after my daughter has discarded it. Most of the toys that she doesn't use anymore go into the charity pile, but I won't torture another mother or child with this one.

"They should have paid more attention to detail: This book is another example of a Cisco Press book that was written in a hurry by a group of people that did not communicate nor did they carefully review their material for errors. Some of the router configuration examples are clearly wrong. The attached CD at times does not reflect the written mateial and asks questions that are not covered in the book! As of May 1, 2003, Cisco has announced that the BSCI 640-901 test (This Book!) is being replaced by a new test - BSCI 642-901.

"Bad Listing, BEWARE: There is no such chip as an AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2. It is a socket F with 1207 pins, not 940 socket AM2 as the ad banner describes. Don't be mislead into believing this is the next chip in the FX Athlon series after the incredible FX 62. It was an interim chip produced before the Quad core chips came out. The only motherboard I can find for it comes from Asus (Even they don't guarantee compatability since the board was designed for an Opteron.) To realize a performance increase over the Athon 6400+, you will need two CPU's, otherwise even the Athon 6000 out performs just a single chip. I do not believe any other board manufacturers are planning boards for this chip. There are ads all over the internet for the AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2, but none of them clearly indicate that this chip is a socket F. I believe there is a lot of inventory out there and this misleading banner is just an attempt to unload an expensive orphaned chip.

"Individuality and freedom.: The first time I read this book I was in fourth grade, and most of of its meaning was lost on me. I have reread this book and a lot of connections were made that I simply was not mature enough to see before. At the ripe old age of nine, I simply did not understand the ideas of freedom and the ability to make choices. Now at 18, I see many of the ideas that went through Jonas' mind paralleled my own as I matured. The sense of individuality and freedom, which I now take for granted, were completely removed from the society Jonas was raised in, yet he found the ideas buried within him. It shows that the breaking away of a maturing child is archetypal in nature. And that, i believe, is the fundamental basis of this novel.

I use tap water so I get a thin film on my glasses (and everything else probably) overnight but this wipes off easily. My only complain is a slight design flaw: When you lift the water reservoir (penquin body) off the base to refill it, it drips water pretty much from the whole circumference of the base. But I figure it has to evaporate and go into the air....hey you wanted to raise the humidty level didn't you?

"These are not the real thing! Not ""PHOTON"": I felt very mislead by this product description from Amazon. This is not the same as a true ""PHOTON"" brand light that I have purchased in the past. The LED is a bluish white, and the ""beam"" diameter is much smaller than the branded ""PHOTON"" light which has a brighter, whiter LED. It has a bunch of screws on the backside (that you can't see in the posted photo) and it looks like it was put together in a sweat shop, whereas the real ""PHOTON"" light says ""MICRO PHOTON LIGHT"" on the obverse and is elegantly constructed with no screws. The key rings are also of a lighter gage, and not of the same quality. I would return, but with the low cost it is not worth the hassle, and this knock-off light should still be handy. Time will only tell if it lasts as long as the real deal. If I could have a ""do-over"" I would have gladly payed more for the real thing; the light that a real ""MICRO PHOTON LIGHT"" produces is brighter and it illuminates a larger area.

"This book doesn't deserve the Forgotten Realms Logo on it.: This book felt like it was written as a generic fantasy book, not set in any known world, and then a few minor things were changed so that they could publish under the FR Logo. BIG MISTAKE. This is a book that ties in spell misuse, lasers, and far too much of our real world, than it does of the Forgotten Realms.If you don't read this from the standpoint of it being a book set in the Realms, its a marginally amusing book. However most of the nifty cool parts are all ruined by the author using LASERS and explosives as the main weapons in the book.Pass on this one unless your bookstore doesn't have soemthing else on it's shelves. And if you HAVE to read it, don't read it assuming it's a Forgotten Realms book.

"Christmas Extraordinaire: I have never written a review before, I never felt the urge until I ordered and received this DVD Audio from Mannheim Steamroller. I'm sorry, I hated it, my wife hated it and all my friends who heard it hated it. From the openning, it didn't sound traditionally ""Christmassy"" at all. Sounded more like some cheesy 80's rendition of classic songs on a Moog. Whilst there is no denying that those who perform on the DVD are very accomplished musicians, I didn't care for it at all. In fact none of us can even sit through track one, and we have ""skipped"" through all of 'em and quite honestly, the cries of ""for Pete sake turn that rubbish off"" were deafenning. Sorry everybody I would like to be able to say something different, but I can't. I bought this based on other reviews and it just go to show, that music taste really is a personal thing. Anybody want it? Yours for the price of the shipping from Kuwait - I mean it, it's worth it, to get rid of it. Merry Christmas to one and all.

"I read a biography...and I liked it!: This is (I'm ashamed to say) the first biography I've read since high school. It was well written, engaging and descriptive without being boring. I'm so glad I stumbled across this book. It has inspired me to find other biographies of the royal family. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that a third of the book was essentially a biography of Prince Albert. However, the book also eloquently gives a tangible picture of who she was as a young woman before the throne and how she matured as a daughter, a wife, a mother and the Queen of England.

"Want My Brain Cells Back: I've been an avid reader of Sci-Fi for over 30 years. In those 30+ years there have been very few books that I hated. Moonseed is one such book. The ridiculous unending descriptions of rocks and landscapes, preparations for spaceflight, and the interminable prattle of the characters thoughts made this a very hard to read book. The author's insistence on creating a new character every time he wanted to describe the destruction of a particular place was confusing and completely unnecessary. Describe the destruction, I don't need a character associated with the destruction to try and make it ""real"" to me. I know it's fiction. The jacket of the book describes the author as an engineer. He needs to stick to writing engineering texts and stay away from fiction. While the author may know a lot about rocks, he knows precious little about planetary mechanics, biology or how to write a decent book. Stephen Baxter is definitely on my ""Do Not Read"" list.

"A great quick resource, but...: While I understand the fact that the point of this book is to quickly bolster a student's ability to speak and understand Russian vis-a-vis applying knowledge of English to Russian cognates, many of the choices listed in this book fall into the following categories:1) False cognates. There are numerous cases where an anglicised or latinate word is rendered into Russian incorrectly. This is confusing for Russians listening to the speaker, who do not understand exactly what the anglophone is trying to say.2) For many of these words, recent borrowings from English exist, but the new word is generally not immediately as usable as the native Russian word. A good choice to show a Russian your wordpower, but not ""&#1086;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1100; &#1087;&#1086;-&#1088;&#1091;&#1089;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;"".Overall, this book was still helpful and did a great job of categorizing words in a logical and easily-readable manner.4/5

"Not just a Lanza look-alike: I first became acquainted with Ricardo Cassinelli in smaller supporting roles. I was pleasantly surprised to find this anthology in which he sings aria from some of the leading tenor roles and is by no means a ""tenorrino"".

"An interesting look behind the scenes of a modern phenomenon: I read this book because I've often heard (and thought myself) that what Edward does is shamefully exploitative. I was curious to see if he had an elaborate ""vision"" of the afterlife, a la the always ridiculous Silvia Browne. I was really surprised with what I found. Edward seems like a genuine, sincere, and likable guy. The focus of the book is his personal rise to fame, which seems to be attributable to hard work and chancing to meet and impress the right people - sort of like anything else. He is very convincing in his assertions that his goal is to help people first and foremost, and the money and attention has simply followed. Personally, I'm not convinced of the existence of his spirit-world ""Boys,"" as he calls his guides, but there does definitely seem to be something unique about this man, and whatever the source, he seems capable of some remarkable things.

"I give this ONLY 2 stars NOT 4!!!: I think this camera takes good pictures with nice features on it, but everytime I take pictures (let's say I've taken about 25 pics) and go back to review the pictures later some of the pictures won't show up, but it'll say ""file corrupted"" with a blue screen instead. When I load the pics on the computer the picture that had that message would either show up distorted or not show up at all. So I took the camera back and exchanged it for another thinking it was defective, but the new camera does the exact same thing. Does anyone else have this problem? This is soooo annoying! Imagine having a nice picture that was a once in a lifetime shot and get ready to review it just for it to be a corrupted file! That is soooooo annoying not to mention pisses me off!!!!

"Our 3 week vacation in Hawaii: We took our kids to Hawaii for 3 weeks first stopping in Honolulu to get acclimated and then spent the rest of our time staying with friends in Kona. We brought several guidebooks along and opened this one first because it had a good map on the inside cover. We switched to the Moon book because it was denser and had better information every time. My wife didn't like the Revealed because it poked fun at the locals.

"Great camera until...it takes the shutter release error: I've had this camera since it first came out. For a while it was wonderful! It took fantastic pictures and it's lightweight and easy to handle. But... October 2010 (on a very important day) it gave me an error about the shutter release button. A friend that is a professional photographer was able to fix it. In July 2011 I got the same error. When this error comes up, the camera doesn't work at all. I sent the camera off to Nikon and it took them about 8 weeks to supposedly fix it. It cost me about $200 to get it fixed. The error came back in September. You can bang on the camera and get the gears to release and it will work temporarily. I've had it with this camera! Before you buy it, Google ""Nikon Error Press Shutter Release"" and you'll find tons of complaints about it. :( I'm looking for a new camera now.

Krug takes you step by step through the process and helps you avoid all the dumb decisions that make so many Web sites annoying and difficult to navigate. His breezy, friendly style makes this book easy to read, even for graphic designers. (Sorry, I didn't mean that.)Seriously, everyone who designs Web sites needs to read this book. I've brought it to work (I work in a marketing communications and design company) and shared it with my colleagues. They liked it too.If you want to create more effective and successful Web sites, you oughta read this book.

"A Disappointing Debut: Mr. Bakker's debut fantasy is, in a word, disappointing. The story is a rather bland one, and you cannot really feel for the characters as much as you should in fantasy novels. This book is also very hard to sit down and read. Bakker's prose is extremely clunky (almost to the point that it is impenetrably poetic) and difficult to follow coherantly. Your best bet is to borrow the book from a library, or from a friend who was stupid enough to buy it.

Are we to believe that all Germans of this era were sociopaths, or that 6,000 Jews were gassed daily at Auschwitz, requiring over 340 tons of human remains to be cremated and disposed of per day? As you read this book keep in mind that the evidence and motivations on all sides are just beginning to crystalize in the historical record. Many aspects of this epic history were not ready to be accurately told at its 1959 publishing, as Mr. Shirer appears to have been content to let the propagandists fill-in many of the blanks.

"Well researched, but nothing exciting: The authors definitely did a fine work by doing excellent research about Microsoft's product development and marketing. This book would prove to be very helpful to those who are coming from a non-technical perspective. It occasionally offers some valuable insights into Microsoft's strategies but it is quite dry for the most part even for a person who has plenty experiences in software development. The Microsoft 'secrets' are not exactly impressive. It would be impossible to know the true secret in a book, otherwise every software company would become a Microsoft (then again, not every company wants to). The book is a bit dated, but nevertheless offers the curious reader some insights into the development and marketing of Microsoft's past successful (and unsuccessful) moves. This book made Microsoft seems to be more fallible than its invincible image of every day praise.

"So What Else Is New?: I measure success for a heavy metal musician in terms of crunch. This man was well into his 40's when he did this cd. I can't think of too many 40somethings that can rock this hard, especially after years of drinking and drugging. Probably his most personal recording, this is an excellent example of how maturity can positively affect an artist's craft. Ozzy never sounded better than on ""Perry Mason"", ""I Just Want You"", ""Thunder Underground"", ""See You On The Other Side"" and ""Old L.A. Tonight."" This is a must have for any rock collector, though Black Sabbath fans may say otherwise. Hardcore metal heads will also say otherwise, but reviewing W.A.S.P., Cannibal Corpse, Metallica, Megadeth, and others is for them to do.

"The Massacre Sucks Ass: Don't waste your time on this crappy album. ""The Massacre"" is selling units simply because of the huge hype machine that is the biggest sellout in the history of rap: 50 Cent.Get Rich or Die Tryin' was a really good album and 50 is a decent rapper. My problem with him is that he is such a shameless sellout who cares only about making money, not about making great music.This album is very weak, but like Ludacris, Fat Joe, Nelly and all the other sellouts who are contaminating rap these days, 50 knows he does not have to make great music to have great record sales. Do yourself a favor and save your money for Ready to Die, Life After Death, or one of Pac's albums. The Massacre is trash.

"Save Your Money!: Though the book in it's entirity is filled with supposition, assumption, presumption, and speculation, the first two-thirds of the book are fairly entertaining. Mr. Thomas tries his hand as a psychic, military tactician, and psychoanalyst; he fails miserably on all counts. He also manages to omit several key incidents in Lee's life which point much more directly to the man's real character and values. While the last third of the book is boring and tedious, Mr. Thomas doesn't miss the opportunity to do a little politically-correct Southern bashing to assure good reviews from the New York Times, et al. In the end, Thomas tries to leave everyone with a comfy-warm feeling which really only serves to undermine much of his own thesis. By the way, nearly ALL white people in the US in the 1800's, whether North or South, abolitionist or slave-owner, educated or ignorant, rich or poor ""believed"" the white race to be superior...even Lincoln. You'd think a professor would know that.

"Dude movie: I've seen the movie by my English teacher. I liked and disliked it. Some people were good, some were not that good. I think that Judge Reinhold (as Brad Halminton) is the best character. He made me laugh so much. In the movie, he is a very good brother. Stacey Halminton (Jenneifer Jason Leigh) is an irresponsible girl. She got pregnant with a stranger (stupid enough). Compared to today's life, 1982 was a ""dude"" life. It seems to be funny and also dangerous. People has sex with everybody, get pregnant. Do they care about VD? Sure, AIDS haven't existed yet, but still... That was the thing I hate about the movie. But I can say that it was a good movie. It reflects well the reality of that year. I would recommand this movie to all people who's 15 and up. If you're not yet, wait untill you're at least 15. (Some scenes may not concern you.) And if you don't like sex (or too young) stay home and rent a comedy.

"A last resort: Only way this unit would be worth anything is as a last resort. Even in full sun it rarely generates more then 120 mA and 80 mA is probably the average and the slightest wisp of cloud drops it to near zero. With todays 2000-2750 mAH rechargeable batteries this unit would take 125 hours to charge 4 2500 mAH batteries. Assuming 6 hours of ""full"" sun a day at 80 mA it would take almost 21 days to charge those four batteries. Real world would be more likely a month.Like I said, maybe if it was all I had, but there are better places to spend your money.

The piano playing is lyrical and pleasant, with plenty of tasteful space interspersed to ""let the music breathe.""

"In The Middle (2.5 Stars): I don't really know what to say about this album. On one hand, some songs are tight. On the other hand, it seems like a perfect waste of a good beat (see track #10). I bought this album because I like most of the Dungeon Family's work. The intro is kind of misleading because it's kind of hot, but most of the album isn't. Some songs play with the beat for so long that it makes you want to skip it (see track #11). Also, I didn't like how an old Outkast beat was jacked on track #9(from the Aquemini outro). Speaking of Aquemini, the hook from ""Slump"" was jacked too (on track #13). This album did make me wonder where Witchdoctor went. He's so underrated.

"Where is my blu ray ?: On Sunday we bought Watchmen (Director's Cut + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]. We paid to receive the blu-ray within 6 days. On thursday, we received a phone call saying that it was too late (18pm30) and that the DVD will be given to us on friday. On friday, we didn't go working and we waited and we always wait. No phone call, no message, nothing. We bought many DVD or books on amazon.fr and we never have had any problem. It was the first -and the last- time we buy on amazon.com. It is not serious.Jealeblanc

"I may be missing something: First, I love the Beach Boys. I think they have some great stuff. I also love the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeplin, old blues, Black Sabbath, and new rock, etc. I am very open minded when it comes to music. I love classical, jazz, opera, every genre. But I apparently have some deficiency when it comes to this album. Although there are a few great songs, I find the album mostly aweful and unlistenable. It is beyond me how some have put this as the greatest rock album of all time. Maybe one day I will wake up and see what I'm missing, but I doubt it.

"Very simple introduction: This book is not a college book on relativity. it is written for curious mind who wants to know something about the relativity and author gives a very layman introduction to it.It starts with space-time concept of Aristotelian, Galilean view and than slowly enters into relativistic view. A lot of space has been delegated to definition and explanation of the concept of Iterval and than jumps into physical meaning of the concepts. It is only as the author says from A to B and no more.

"Great test review: I took my ANCC exam Feb 2009 and passed with flying colors and this book really helped. I used the CD several times, perhaps once daily 2 weeks before the test and it was extremely helpful. The CD generates a different test every time from the same bank of questions. Some questions were very similar as those as the ones in the exam. Another excellent sources were Margaret Fitzgerald and Maria Leik, I found these textbooks very helpful while preparing for the exam.If you use these books you should not have a problem. I also used the ANCC review guide it was good but $$. Good luck.

"A definite grower: I bought this CD right when it came out, liking Source Direct's earlier stuff. I was originally a bit disappointed, if only because it repeated two tracks from their earlier releases, and because it didn't seem all that special. But after repeated listening, the tracks really grow on you, with their great rhythm parts, always weaving around the eery bass-line melodies, and the ""special effects"" puncutuating everything. That may sound awfully eclectic, and Source Direct is certainly not for those who have never listened to any jungle before. Still, it's one of the albums that can bear close listening and improve.

"Content needs to be brought up to date.: Want to code bit mapped circles and arcs? Want to re-invent ""pong?"" This is your book. Want to code business aplications - this book is a waste. There is more attention paid by the author to ""Fun With Fonts"" than to things that have been significantly improved in .NET like TreeView.I get the sense Petzold wrote the original content for this book back in the 80's and has re-cycled it one time too many.The title of the book inferred a little bit of help in using VB.NET to tap into the new Window's .NET Framework. It does - but it sticks to the things you could do in the Windows API several years ago. IMHO, in 2004 we are way beyond lines, curves, brushes, pens, images and bitmaps.This is another author going through the motions and updating old content.

"Over produced, underwritten melodrama.: Woefully inept dramatization of the fate of Spanish poet Garcia Lorca. Top-notch cast is thrown away, while the period detail is totally wasted.

"New Table Model is Inferior to the Earlier Model of the same table: I have purchased two (2) other Table-Mate II Woodgrain tables previously and am very satisfied with those. However, this one has been changed by the manufacturer. The support bar for the underside of the flat surface has been downsize in diameter. The support bar will not stay in place if the table is lifted as is the case with my previous tables. This makes it very awkward and un-safe when you try to relocate the table to different locations.

"I folded on this book: I am fascinated by the world of competitive poker and I love a great murder/crime story. I thought this would be the perfect book my summer reading. I looked forward to learning about the sorrid history of Binion's WSOP and how to survive the tournament. I gave up about halfway through. The author is a journalist and you can tell. He can't sustain a train of thought for more than 5 pages. How did his editor let him get away with this?What I really hated was the Bad Jim/Good Jim. The multiple page soliquy on whether or not to receive a lap dance served absolutely no purpose. His inner ramblings only made me dislike the author more. I was hoping he would be eliminated from the tournament and his wife would leave him for losing thousands of dollars.

"the mirror has two faces...: and Los Angeles is reflected in the faces of Tim and Perry Newman, twin angelinos whose lives and careers take various turns in the novel. fast paced and often especially hilarious to native los angeles readers, The Other Side of Mulholland gives its reader a delicious peek into what it's like to live in the shadow of the great evil empire that is ""upper"" los angeles. Randall lovingly develops his twin protagonists and manages to portray Tim, the gay twin, without relying on gay stereotypes to make him interesting. Secondary characters receive an unusual amount of attention in the novel, which works to effectively make the reader sympathize with them and the situations they face. I breezed through this novel in only a few days, and when it was over, i found myself wanting more. Sadly, though, it will likely be a great challenge to find another contemporary work that so accurately describes Los Angeles in quite the manner that this novel does.

"Thank you, Michael Shermer: I found Shermer's book to be an excellent yet basic treatise about the nonsense that passes as truth in some circles . It's disturbing to find that there are people out there (even some who are otherwise well-educated) who believe that the Holocaust never happened or who toss aside science from 1850 forward in favor of creationism. And yet Shermer shows us that they not only exist but that they are trying to infect others with their ""pseudoscience, superstition, and other confusions."" I think one reason some of them are actually successful is that there are not enough people like Michael Shermer out there explaining the difference between science and pseudoscience. Finally, I appreciate the fact that Shermer points out that not all skeptics and believers in real science are atheists as the fundamentalist Christian right would have the American public believe.

Its great for what I need it to - take family pics etc. The only thing I'd like to see is the ability to take good pictures in low light.

It's large enough to fit a paper coffee filter into, into which I can fit the quantity of yogurt that I want to strain (the handle of the other strainers, even of comparable size, always tipped over even with the yogurt inside) and it stays put levelly atop a typical size glass's rim.

"Torn curtain: Madonna has proven that she can mature without losing her edge, but this new song is a grave disappointment. It doesn't come up with something refreshing like ""Ray of light"", which was a remarkable mix of techno beats and avant-garde pop. Instead, ""Music"" is simply sampled together from bits of '70s disco songs, and the lyrical content is very primitive. When I listened to the song for the first time, I thought it was Britney Spears. The remixes are alright but add nothing new to the original version, meandering in spots and falling into repetition. Also, I don't think that Madonna has engaged A-list remixers, since they were chosen by commercial aspects. ""Music"" is the first Madonna single I've totally disliked.

"NOT Multi-Directional, NOT a Suitable Indoor Antenna: The Antennas Direct DB2 is FAR from multi-directional and is NOT a suitable INDOOR antenna as suggested in the product description. If you have the luxury of sticking it outside, I'm sure it MUST work better since there are so many people with glowing reviews.I live in a 'yellow' coded metropolitan area and thought for sure the DB2 would allow me to grab every last drop of signal available, however, the RCA Multi-Directional Digital Flat Amplified Antenna I bought for $24.99 at Walmart outperformed it HANDS DOWN in channels received and signal strength; not to mention the 8 inch x 8 inch, white RCA looks a MILLION times better than the 2 ft. x 2 ft. scarecrow of the digital world, the DB2.Bottom line: They should stick with their original description as a uni-directional OUTDOOR antenna.I can't believe I'm going to say this, but...

"While not bad, take with a grain of salt...: First, my comment to my partner was ""Well, if you take any number of self-help relationship books, and add three pages about ADHD, you'll have a better help book than this one.""Pros:1. It does help one to think about ADHD and relationships.2. It does help create talking points with your partner about your relationship.Cons:1. It uses pseudoscience and unproven theories of how ADHD works as some of its basis for discussion.2. It is very heavy on the belief that medication can make one with ADHD ""normal"". While psychopharmacological assistance for people with ADHD is good, psychological is also good, and the book tends to ignore that aspect.3. It is based on a traditional M/F married relationship.Overall, I don't know that there is anything better out there. However, this doesn't say this is good.Personally, I'd find a good book on ADHD, and a good book on relationship counseling, and read them together.

"too short for such a major musical figure: It is unfortunate that there is not more available on Debussy in English. This book, at only 167 pages (including pictures) hardly does him justice. Because it is so short, the book jumps from topic to topic at an alarming pace, hardly giving any details. The author's convoluted writing style does not help matters either.

I Know Who Holds Tommorow and As We Lay, you can just feel the power and emotion in her voice. Another touching song is The Lullaby, which is dedicated to her children, who sing with her.

Ozawa remains objective enough with his interpretations that I am not left feeling like I'm listening to Ozawa's Ravel, but rather simply Ravel. The Boston Symphony is at the top of its form throughout all the performances. Having played for as long as they had previously under Charles Munch they have a nicely appropriate French sound for the music, but with a complementary American roundness to the sound to go with it. The excellent sound of the Boston Symphony Hall is well known enough as to not need comment. As far as I'm concerned, I'll not be needing another recording of this music. Highly recommended.

"Missing part: We purchased the bassinet a 3 weeks prior to our baby's arrival. When we put the bassinet together we realized that it was missing a lock to keep the bassinet from rocking. Babies R us told us to contact the manufacturer for the part. The manufacturer said that there would be a 5 week delay in getting the part to us. 3 and 1/2 months later, we still have not recieved the lock. We called 4 times and the representatives said they could not do anything about it because it was on back order. Their manual says do not use the bassinet if any parts are missing. They seemed to not care about this statement because no matter how many times I have called they have made no attempt to get me the part like they keep saying they would. I cannot place my baby in the bassinet without her rolling to one side which can cause possible suffication and that is because she is only 7 lbs. Good luck if you have to deal with Babies R us or Customer Relations department for Eddie Bauer.

Not one funny scene, not one! Sandler should seriously consider packing it in after this film, he is a menace with a script & camera. And Sandberg...dude...you seriously left SNL for THIS? I'm seeing shades of David Caruso...if I could have given it no stars, I would have. Run, don't walk, away from this stinker.

"Buy this before it's gone!: Well, I don't have much to say about THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Either you get it, or you don't, and either you love it, or you hate it; I've never discovered a ""middle ground"" of opinion about this film.More importantly for you, the RHPS fan, is that you scoop this title up quick! FOX is quickly putting their special edition DVDs out of print, and already they've begun to replace this excellent 2-disc set with a much less impressive, plain vanilla 1-disc. The special features and documentary features on this disc are quite good, and though I found the menus a little annoying, they're certainly a minor complaint to this otherwise fine release. Get it now, before it's gone!

"Masive money waste...: This audio card is good if you are only going to connect to two channels, and don't even expect actual 3D sound, no the left front and back will play the same thing also the right front and back. So if you are actually looking for a just stereo sound card this is what you are looking for. I almost forgot to tell you, it is a pain in the back to get the drivers, and when you get the drivers in startech.com you can install it but then wait until your screen turns blue... yes the blue screen we all fear... My advice is don't buy it! i will have to buy another one. i would give it -2 stars but that's not possible :(

"the crying of elevator 11: I know: elevator inspectors? And the dustcover looks grim. But this thing is funny, funny and dark, gritty and wise, with a good dose of giddy surrealism, prose that'll make you catch your breath, and a plot that's what would happen if Pynchon's Oedipa Maas happened to get trapped in Ellison's ""The Invisible Man."" And yo, can this man write! All the gushing about his literary lineage is right on target, but like the best writers, the echoes aren't the totality of his style--he's a young writer who is assured enough of the skills he has and the story he has to tell to claim the main veins of American literature as his own. Read this book. I'm telling you, this is talent.

"Very Nice!: A great pairing, really. This wasn't where I started on my Fela collection, but having listened to it quite a few times now I have to rank it among my favorites like Confusion/Gentleman, Opposite People/Sorrow, Tears, and Blood. In the first 30 seconds or so of 'Everything Scatter' I knew I was going to like this, and of course (go Fela!) wasn't disappointed. I admit I'm particularly intrigued with track #2 and stunned to awake when it's done. It's one of those Fela grooves that take you on vacation (so to speak) and let you really think for a minute. Love the CD.

"A Disappointment To Our Community: Our friend gave us this book for Hanukah thinking it might help our situation. But it turned out to be a disappointment. We expected it to contain more information about unmarried polyamory. For instance, when one is poly does one keep a spare bedroom...or two? What sorts of problems and awkwardness arise? How do you explain being poly to your grandfather who is skeptical?? The only mention of this subject is a passing reference when the Authors discuss the reasons people choose not to marry. One reason, they say is so-and-so might have more than one partner. The rest of the book consists of boring facts about common law marriage and so forth which can be found in any marriage guide. It appears Solot and Miller are trying to appeal to the mainstream..... This seems like selling out to us.

"Yet another cheap product.: This is yet another disappointment. I have purchased four back brushes in the last few months. Three have broken almost immediately. Each was made in China and, after close examination, they are made of very thin material under the rubbery grip. This one has not broken yet, but it is made in China and has very thin material under the grip (same location the others broke). The brush itself is rather nice, but the wood brush area split after the first use and bristles are beginning to fall out. I give it another week at most. I think Fuller, while very expensive, is probably the best value. Stores need to recognize the junk and stop pushing it to us as consumers. And we, as consumers, need to stand up and rebel against this type of garbage.

"Broken base in less than a month (light use): This little coat rack is attractive and inexpensive. It is super easy to put together and I recieved it in two days with Amazon Prime. It is a bit unsteady, but serves it's purpose well enough...you just can't pile too many coats on it or it will likely tip over. Seems like there should be another leg on it that might would prevent this from happening. The pegs that hold the coats are also kind of short. I was happy enough with my purchase until today when a piece of wood on the base broke off leaving one of the legs unable to fit onto it, therefore, rendering it useless after less than a month of very light use. I am going to try to glue the piece back on, but I am skeptical that it will hold up too long if at all. I threw the box away so I doubt I could get a replacement, but if the glue doesn't work, I may try. If it were not for the poor quality of craftmanship, I would have given this product a 5 for what it is.

While this version still will be useful in its own ways, I would recommend getting the Harvard UPress version.

"Informative read: The book covers all the bases with respects to the compilation of the Scriptures. It explains the reasons as to why the Catholic bible is different from Protestant bibles, such as the Apocraphal books and even some differences in the New Testament. It explains how shoddy translations have glutted the biblical world with poor renderings. It is not a scholarly book but would be good for those Catholics who have a protestant friend who might want to have these and other questions answered. The only drawback is the tone of the book , a bit aggressive towards protestant objections concerning the Catholic church and her approach to the bible.

"My thoughts on the Futura: Recently purchased the Futura thumb splint for rather severe arthritis of the thumb. Had tried several OTC products which were uncomfortable and of little benefit to me. I'd run into a stranger wearing a splint, chatted with him about his reason for, and the product name. He told me he was very satisfied with his FUTURA for arthritis of his thumb, wore it always and even did woodworking with it on, and how I might purchase it through the Internet. He was so enthused about his thumb stabilizer that he took it off for me to try it on, large though it was! A walking talking advertisement! I have two smaller stabilizers of my own now, wear one at night, and often during the day. Far superior to other products I've used. It is comfortable, reasonable, and provides relief. Certainly worth trying! Carol, Hartland, WI.

"IF you buy the Fuji S7000 YOU'LL BE SOORRREEEE!: I have a Fuji S5000 and thought it a good camera for the price. It takes sharp photos with great color under all conditions. I wanted to go to a 6MP camera and for the price the Fuji S7000 looked like a great deal. Boy was I wrong. My S5000 3MP takes better pictures than the S7000. The camera would not focus for anything. The indoor shots were horribly Under exposed and constantly fuzzy, even with the setting on sharp. The color was dull and the auto focus just does not work well in low light conditions (by low light I mean indoors where people like to shoot photos of their family). If your on a budget try the S5000 I think you'll be happy. If you can afford to go to the $1,000.00 range go with the Canon EOS. Or the new Sony 8MP camera. IF you buy the Fuji S7000 YOU'LL BE SOORRREEEE!

I've now heard it many, many times (or does it just seem like that to me?), and it hasn't started to sound any better to me.The voice is that of a very average singer and the production is rather old fashioned and vulgar. It sounds a bit like Roxette meets Nick Kershaw with a heavy serving of Euro-trash (but it isn't that good!).I am not sure what one is supposed to do with this album.

Frightening in its self but only a taste of what is to come. It seems that he is invincible and is targeting all the Sara Connors in the phone book. Each one being dispatched more violently than the last. A less robust being (Michael Biehn) also appears the same way. He too is seeking Sara.What is so intriguing about Sara Connors (Linda Hamilton)?Who will find her first?What effect can the outcome have on humankind?I thought Arnold's accent added to the character of the movie.

"QOTSA had better thank the gods of rock for LANEGAN: This cd is bad folks. It has two bright spots, both are songs that have Mark Lanegan on vocals. Another song he sings on, not even he could save. I really enjoy the song Into the FADE, but as for the rest of the cd, the only cd I have bought that I liked less was MONSTER by REM. The only thing that made that worse, was the band is so good, that the expectations were higher for REM. Queens of the Stone Age have recruited Mark Lanegan as a contributing force, and I will buy the cd to hear his voice, but as big of a fan as I am, if it's as bad as RATED R, I will be back here and trying to keep you from buying it too! Buy his solo cds, and his CDs with Screaming Trees, but stay away from Rated R. Into the Fade is not worth the 12 dollars the cd will cost you. As always, be well people, and listen to music that fills your soul, not this which fills your toilet!

"DIDDY STRIKES BACK: Diddy knows how to get the tightest MC's all in one CD. He got it from Jigga to Nelly and also his new group from 'MTV's Making The Band.' His crew came up and he still won't stop DAMMM!!. The traxs on this CD are cool but some are not impressive. Some songs could have used a little touch ups but still sound good. The hot trak by Jay-Z ""La La La"" is blazin', Neptunes keep knockin at the streets.Yaoh Ming. And the other track I recommend is Da Band's track ""WHY"", that song is real tight, they came up in the game for real Diddy know what he got and put his mind to it.

"Book would be okay if it took ""Ultimate"" out of the title: If you're newly nappy, this book is probably for you. It gives some general information on hair textures and has some interesting styles. ""Ultimate"" it ain't. The author apparently isn't aware that there are several excellent natural hair care texts that cover this ground more thoroughly than she does. She even claims to have invented the twist out. Now for all I know she may be right, but there is at least one book out there (Pamela Ferrell's Let's Talk Hair) that already addresses this style by that name, and another (Lonnice Brittenum Bonner's books) that use another name but is essentially the same style). If you've been nappy for a number of years and are looking for an ""ultimate"" style book, give this book a pass. If you're newly nappy, buy Pamela Ferrell's Let's Talk Hair, and take this book out of the library for some additional styles.

"Folk blues: Brownie McGhee and Sonny Terry recorded a handful of albums for the Folkways label in the 1950's, out of which was collected an excellent CD compilation called The Folkways Years. This complete album was made in November 1957 and is typical of what they were doing at this time. By typical I don't mean average, but very good. The material tends toward folk blues - older styles, traditional verses, etc. JOHN HENRY gets yet another treatment and OLD JABO, a minstrel tune, also appears. Sonny sings a tribute to Huddie Ledbetter (""Leadbelly"") in BEST OF FRIENDS, a tune he also recorded on the Bluesville label. Although nothing here really jumps out and bangs you on the head in ecstasy, everything is done professionally and consistently well. Brownie's smooth, sophisticated vocals are always a delight.

"Stark Raving Dub: If Simon Posford (Hallucinogen, Younger Brother, Shpongle, etc., etc., etc.) is a barking mad scientist (and all evidence points in that direction), then OTT is the full moon he howls at. To say that these are radical reinterpretations of Posford classics in a PsyDub stylee would be technically accurate; however, that simply doesn't begin to touch on the shrieking lunacy buried right to the hilt in the body of this work. One is struck, physically, by the force of the opening of this album, placing one in a dazed state entirely proper for the depth of listening the material demands. And this material most certainly makes demands on the listener, albeit demands I happily concede: awash in thunderous bass, lilting butterflies of synth, and chattering psychobabble, OTT engages the screens of the senses in an intensely cinematic drama that is good to the last drop. Essential.

"This book is disturbing: I understand how adults may be touched by the message of unconditional love, but this book is just plain creepy. We received it as a gift, and i have never thrown away a book before, but this one has got to go. The relationship of the mother and son is not healthy.

We used the recommended anti-mold product but the smell was very strong. The filter was getting dirty so fast we had to change it very often, which makes maintenance expensive.

"A Good And Happy Child = a good and happy reader!: Mr Evans has produced a superbly written debut novel with ""A Good And Happy Child"". The characters in the novel are tremendously written and all who appear on the page Evans makes them shine with life. Demonic possession features strongly in the story but forget all visions of the scenes from the ""Exorcist"" movie, this novel approaches the subject in a more subtle and psychological manner. Also worthy of note is that you can tell how Evans has painstakingly researched into the subject matter and it truly shows in the prose. I've read a few comments by other reviewers that mention a disappointing ending to the story, I myself thought it worked extremely well and it got under my skin! It still keeps coming into my head; and that to my mind, is a hallmark of an excellent ending. A Good And Happy Child is well worth your time, it's top class fiction, and I for one am happy to own a copy, don't wait for the paperback.

"My Opinion: Beethoven in Paradise is not what I expected. I originally bought this book because my son plays the violin and I thought he might like it. I'm glad I read it first because I'm not sure I'll let him read it just yet since he's nine years old and I have a pretty strict policy about the use of profanity, which this book has in ample supply. (I'd give it a PG 13.) The use of profanity is justified, though, and adds greatly to the authenticity of the setting and characters. I would highly recommend it to students of middle school age and would consider reading it aloud to my fourth graders, although I would have to use quite a few euphemisms. The messages in this book are so powerful: Be true to yourself, stand up for what you believe in, and follow your dreams. Even though I sort of wanted a sappy ""everything's going to turn out alright"" ending, the actual ending was very realistic and genuine.

"Fairstein was in over her head on this one: I've read all the Fairstein novels with Alex Cooper, so obviously I like them. But this one shows me Fairstein tried to do more complex plotting and failed. The story was convoluted, with too many characters all dealing with ancient (and rather boring) history.Unliike some of the other reviewers who couldn't finish the book, I did make myself finish, but I knew the ending was going to be dumb and anticlimactic. And I wasn't wrong.Not Fairstein's best work.P.S. Ms. Fairstein, Alex is interesting, but she's also very pretentious (i.e. ""the house in the country,"" etc.). And her relationship with Jake is almost romance-novel-like in the way it's described. (I.e., the ""I-want-my-lover-to-take-me-in-his-arms-and-make-me-feel-loved-and-adored"" crap.) Maybe tone down the pretentiousness and perhaps try to describe Alex's relationship in a less sappy way?

"Very pleased with Todd's solo cd: Anybody who is a fan of true rock will want to check out this cd. I was a huge fan of Buckcherry's 1st cd, still listen to it, so i decided to listen to Todd's cd at a local cd store. After the 1st track I was hooked. The entire album is good and each song is something fresh and different and the album has yet to become tired as so many others in recent years have. After reading interviews with Josh Todd I was surprised to find somebody who cuts out all the bs and gets down to what true musicians are supposed to do which is play rockin, real music. The guy has the image and the musical talent and presence to back it up. Rarely do I write reviews but I would like to see this album take off and haven't seen the publicity that it deserves. Spread the word.

The second one worked fine, and still does, but keeps loosing its wheels. The third one was bought on June 17 and again had a power cord short. It produced a big spark and scared my wife who was using it at the time. The short always occurs at the point where the cord enters the body of the vacuum cleaner. I think that I am going to buy another one and just put a rubber sleeve around the area to prevent the cable from fraying and twisting.

"Boy, it's Genius: This is a fair and thoughtful account of George Bush's ascendency and the GOP takeover of Texas, both masterfully executed by Karl Rove. This is a must read for any political junkie of either political party. Rove comes off as part madman, part genius, part Machiavellian mastermind and also a man of somewhat questionable character. Nonetheless, he decimated the Democratic Party in Texas and concocted the strategy that put a man in the White House who, at the time, was clearly not ready for primetime. I found that I couldn't put the book down, always eager to find out what Rove's next political chess move would be.

"A remarkable film, I wonder if Chris Nolan (memento) saw it?: Winter Sleepers... if one hasn't guessed by other work by Tykwer that he loves to explore and deconstruct a ""moment"", to watch the ripple effects from seemingly random encounters, this film will cement arguements on what his auteur paradigm is.As a piece of cinema, Winter Sleepers is engaging in its eliptical nature. Camerawork, acting, story (except the denoument) are top-notch, the production design and color schema are intriguing, too. Perhaps not Tykwer's best work, but still well worth repeat viewing (my standard for a DVD purchase) -- and heads above the vast majority of American Independent cinema.

"100% Satisfaction!: I got this for my birthday not a week ago. I knew that I was getting it and I was not expecting it to be that great because it is so cheap. This pedal is great if you just want a little distortion undertone, or a lot of it for a solo (I for one think that the guitar solo for Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" sounds great with a lot of distortion). I didn't have any problems with my amp broadcasting a radio station, and I didn't mind the batteries because there were a bunch of them in a drawer in my house. I think that a distortion pedal is a great thing for me to have because it opens me up to so many different sounds to experiment with. I sometimes mess around with it for an hour! Its so much fun! I would recommend this to any guitarist who doesn't have one anyone who doesn't want to waste money on something that sounds almost exactly the same.

"Misrepresentation: not Belkin, not 20 AWG: This is a Monoprice #5438 cable with a sticker put over the original label saying Belkin Gold Series. Monoprice is a Chinese brand that actually has a legitimate looking web site and even has specifications for cables. The spec's for this cable are 24 AWG for the power wires, not the 20 AWG specified in the Amazon listing. I purchased this specifically to get the heavier wire for my high current application, and the difference in voltage drop between 20 AWG and 24 AWG is a factor of 2.5, which at 500mA of current means the total voltage drop will be 150mV instead of 60mV. This is a misrepresentation by the seller, pure and simple. Belkin, L-com and perhaps others have cables with the heavier wires if that is important to you. For most applications it will probably work fine.

"Confused?: You may be baffled by the lineup on this ""Beach"" movie - while Annette is back in her ""DeeDee"" role, she's now ""Deadhead's"" (Jody McCrea) girlfriend rather than Frankie's. Frankie, meanwhile, takes the role of a Martian military commander (you can tell it's Mars because they used a red filter over the camera lens!) - maybe after playing ""Potato Bug"" in ""Bikini Beach"" he thought he was stretching his chops. Tommy Kirk is, not surprisingly, uneasy in his role as the Martian sent to Earth by Frankie to hang out with Annette and various other nubile females. Things are marginally improved by the antics of Buster Keaton, Dorothy Lamour appears long enough to sing a tune, and Elsa Lanchester does her patented airheaded-old-lady act to perfection. Harmless nostalgic fun, but whoever made this page, and thinks this movie is rated ""R"", is insane. Strictly G-rated stuff - it IS 1964, after all!

"An amazing, page turning story.: I really enjoyed this book. When I picked it up I wasn't sure what to expect but it has not disappointed. It is the most amazing life story (so far) of a young boy born into a life of drug dealing, gangs and organised crime. It follows the tale of Burrel as he grows up, as he makes illegal millions only to lose it all. How on earth he lived to tell the tale is a mystery. What he has done however, is turned his experiences into positives, this is a real story of ethics and transformation. This book offers two things, a real insiders account into the gang culture and crime worlds of Chicago. It is also a great read, compelling and incredible. I couldn't put it down. If you want to deepen your understanding of gang culture this is for you but if you just want a great page-turner of a story this is it too.

"A short but terrific 3rd season: Cut short by the writers strike, still season 3 rumbles along on all cylinders like it's trade mark '67 Chev Impala. New characters -- Ruby, Bela and Lilith -- are introduced to good affect. There are some nice touches : ""A Very Supernatural Christmas"", a sense of urgency as Dean's year is racing toward a rendevouz with Hell and an episode that has the charm of ""Groundhog Day"". The wit is still there. A town is inflected by demons and the boys have been locked in jail by their FBI nemesis. Under the possession of a demon he shoots the town sheriff dead. After being released he gasped, ""I shot the sheriff!"" To which Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackless) replies, ""But you didn't shoot the deputy.""

"A timeless masterpiece: This book's main plot, Jane's growing love for her student's caretaker, seems almost fluffy. But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the ""classes"" of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future. There is no such thing as a ""plain Jane"". I highly recommend reading this book because it will leave you thinking about it months after it is read.

"perfect for my needs: I wanted a product that would allow me to hook my Mac up to my stereo so that I could play my newly loaded itunes library from my computer. I know I could have done it wirelessly via airport, but it seemed unnecessarily expensive. I'm handy enough to run a bit of wire through my basement, so with this unit and a 30 foot RCA stereo cord from Radio Shack, I was in business - and at half the price of the airport adapter.I'm extremely satisfied as it works perfectly for my current needs, and as a bonus I'll now be able to simply flip the in/out switch on the Griffin, move the RCA plugs on my stereo to the output jacks, and finally be able to add all my LPs to my itunes. I couldn't be happier.

"Very good and a little disappointing: A long-time fan of FFVII myself, I love Advent Children and the quality of the film, I still believe SquareEnix to be THE best cinematic makers in the gaming business. I love the extras that the 2 disc comes with but there is something people don't know.The japanese version 2 disc special edition has something that any fan of FF would love to have, it has the short animated film of Final Fantasy VII: Lost Order plus other extras like commentary and such.I feel the U.S market is being shafted a little because of this extras that don't come with ours and I don't like that at all. I feel that the animated film should have been included in the special edition.I'm pro for this movie, definitly, but I am disappointed in the marketing/publishing companies who took away the rest of our extras.

"Can't go wrong for $8: I just got one of these about a week ago, and I'm really happy with it.People have expressed concerns that they might accidentally cut themselves on this, but I don't think it's a real issue. The key opens up 180 degrees, and locks at BOTH 90 and 180 degrees. So, if you want to use it as a saw/pocket knife, it will lock out straight. It you want to use the screwdriver, it will lock at 90 degrees so you'll have a sturdy handle. This locking feature also means that it is easy to close the key without cutting yourself.The tool feels very sturdy. It's apparent that a lot of thoughtful design was put into this product. Highly recommended.

"Not at useful as one might think,: I purchased this book to add to my collection and found that it contained less information than one might find in a basic stagecraft book found at any college bookstore. It is my opinion that some of the staging ideas though sound if done properly could be hazardous otherwise. I suggest that if you are not experienced in stagecraft to purchase this book along with a companion stagecraft book and pull from both sources to design and build your show. There are some good suggestions for easy to move lightweight pageant grade sets and this source should not be overlooked. I simply sugest that you not use this as your only reference. To the experienced builder - skip this text all together the designs in the book are old and you most likely will kick your self and say I know how to put plywood platforms on sawhorses why did I buy this!.

"Unoriginal...dissappointing: This was a dissapointing book. It was a rip-off of the lord of the rings--even the note at the end is like lord of the rings (""may your swords stay sharp"") the language Paolini made up is unoriginal and is just like what the elves speak in the Hobbit. Every time Eragon got into a conflict, he went unconscious and appeared somewhere safe when he woke up. He goes unconscious in almost every chapter and there is only one main plot line--no mini twists or turns--altogether it was pretty predictable. And even the main character's name, Eragon, sounds just like Araghorn from LOTR.

"Depressing: Sweet movie, but It wasnt funny enough to overcome the awkwardness of having to watch them stumble through their sexual reuniting.

I will take note before watching other $1.99 movies.

"""You were my first kiss...ever!"": Friends - The Complete Tenth Season is the last in the show's amazing 10-year run. The last season was the shortest as well, only 18 episodes. Some of the episodes are funny and entertaining and some are not. Season 10 is a mixed bag, you can tell the writers really started running out of ideas. The series finale is incredibly moving and spoiler alert! Ross and Rachel finally get back together (they are so meant to be, seriously!). Monica and Chandler finally get a baby, well twins actually. Phoebe gets married to Mike and Joey well he's character went on to star in an unsuccessful spin-off.

"""Sex in the South"" is a fun and informative gift: When our event management company had an opportunity to do a non-traditional Valentine's segment on a local TV station we suggested Suzi Parker's ""Sex in the South"" as a fun and informative gift.

"**Paramount television** Creator Of The **Volume TV Season's**: Dynasty - Season Three, Vol. 1In what can be considered the ultimate step in GREED Paramount is releasing 1/2 seasons of Dynasty and other shows, just like twentieth century fox did for lost in space and voyage to the bottom of the seaIs the show worth the high price tag? I have watched season's one and two and the transfers look good, but there are no extras worth mentioningLet's face it; beyond the 5th season this show went down hill and I think the network is trying to get as much as they can for this product to make up for the loss of profits later on.The releases for this title are taking a long time. Keep in mind the DVD market is closing on it's 15th birthdayRemember those tv shows that $cost over $100 per box set that came from Paramount?

"A Novel Full Of Hot Air: I wanted to try out another adventure writer other than the ones I've been reading. I thought I'd give Clive Cussler a try since I read Raise The Titanic.The setups in the beginning were long-winded and gave absolutely no relation to the story whatsoever till somewhere towards the end of the book. It served to confuse the readers greatly until strangely and coincidentally enough the Dirk Pitt chances upon them.The book is full of male bravado and machoism. It was shameless in the way Clive included himself into the novel as one of the characters searching for the lost ship. At the same time, the people who seem not to die or get injured miraculously is Dirk Pitt. Everyone else he knows dies.The plot itself was very round about, back and forth and linear. I hope the movie would prove a better watch. Otherwise, some interesting facts about survival in the Sahara that's about it.

"This is the worst Whistler radar detector: I have owned a number of Whistler radar detector units over the years. They have generally performed well and to my satisfaction.I bought this new Whistler XTR-140 about three months ago. I decided to put this through some tests across the western US before I start to rely on it.This unit has very poor detection capability - in most cases it will only go off when the radar is within a few hundred feet, with the radar gun looking straight at this detector unit. Had I been speeding, I would have collected a number of speeding tickets. Within the city limits, the unit almost constantly beeps with false alarms. It provides no reliable laser performance, as with a police laser unit almost within a 10 degrees of the line of sight of my car, this detector showed no activity.Its periscope is annoying and along with the poor detection performance gives you Xmas lighting only.I'd avoid this unit - it is a complete waste of money.

"Much anticipated...much to my disappointment: As a huge John Grisham fan, I have read virtually every one of his books. I can easily say that this was not only my least favorite but it was really just a very poorly thought out book in general. Nearly the entire book is character development for a character that never really does anything. There is no direct conflict in this book, no ""on the edge of your seat"" suspense and most of it is about an ex-broker learning to speak Italian. The book is written like Grisham just needed to release a book in 2005 like he does every year. This one was planned very poorly

The other of Powell's RCA recordings (Swingin' with Bud) is far superior, if still not in the first rank of Powell performances. For those, you need to go to the first two volumes of ""The Amazing Bud Powell"", or some of his Verve recordings. This one is just for the competists (like myself) out there.

It was far too much information on flora and fauna interspersed with Greek origins (gymnosperms - gymnos sperma - naked seeds). I felt as though I was in a botany class and it was too boring for me.After finally getting through the book -- it took me about a week of perseverance -- I came to the conclusion that the author had a disdain for the male population and it came through with her treatment of Thomas and Beazley. Maybe it was just a feminist leaning, I don't know.The one thing I got out of the book was an interest in Easter Island. I will read true accounts of the history of the island and hopefully get a better understanding of its geography and its stone statues (moai).It certainly wouldn't be a book I would put on my shelf.

I thought nothing of it as it would give me a better feel for the trigger anyways (I originally wanted to cut the index finger down to half length so the padding my index finger could sit flush with the trigger).

"Sad !!!!!: The conversations are brilliant along with the drill. However there is no written transcripts for you to verify the spellings or the subtleties of pronunciation, and very often the tense changes with a minor twist in pronunciation, which our non french ears may not be able to decipher. Considering the high cost of the package the company should have included the transcripts, maybe in a soft form.The other thing is that grammar is not really explained during the course. Its more rote learning. I would strongly recommend the 10 CD Michel Thomas method along with the Advanced course. Not only are the transcripts there, but the tenses and grammar are explained very well, as well as its far cheaper.

When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others: Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.Shame on you, Amazon.

"I've Got To Change: I thought it was a great book. Although the author intended it for a younger audience than myself, I still felt as though I benefited a lot from it. I really related to what he had to say and thought that it was very admirable for him to put himself on the line like that. I also liked how he saw God interacting in his life which gave me some things to think about in my own life. I was a very surprised by the review on here that said it was a dumb book. Those of you who read it can understand what I mean.

"You get what you pay for.: I had a Delonghi Toaster Oven for many years, and used it constantly. When it finally stopped working I read the reviews and thought I should try a different brand. Big mistake. The Hamilton Beach is priced right, but it doesn't do most of what a toaster oven should do.First, if you just want a small oven to bake or broil, this works just fine, as long as you read the directions and understand how the on and off dial works. The only negative about the oven part is that the tray that comes with it warps when it gets hot. It shouldn't do that.As a toaster, this hardly works at all. Unlike my prior toaster oven, this is designed so the bottom elements heat up before the top ones. That means bagles need to go cut side down, so it is hard to know when they are done. I have learned that when the edge starts to burn, the middle will be almost lightly done. In addition, because the top turns on later, melted cheese on toast is quite difficult to make.

"Very Poor Quality....I would return it if postage weren't so expensive.: These are the very poorest quality dominoes and set that I have ever purchased.I would return it if I hadn't already opened it and if the return postage wasn't so expensive. The dominos are not smooth and the paint is smeared. The colors are odd and the trains are of poor color...two are very nearly the same color The train engine won't whistle, and the case won't last long it is so flimsy. And to top it off, the directions are not written clearly or in proper language at all. If I didn't already know the rules of the game, I certainly couldn't learn to play from these directions. I would find another manufacturer to purchase the Mexican Train Game from.

I trusted this device to protect my home and now I've lost another $1000 in belongings. If you want to brace a door, get yourself long bolts and brace your door with a 2X6 and screw the hardware in on each side to hold it up. I'm not sure the name of the metal pieces but they simply are used to baricade the door.

"VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ONE!: I have read almost every one of James Patterson's books and really enjoyed the Alex Cross series. I was even okay with his really far off premises in some of the others (kid's with wings...was he kidding?!), but this one is really dragging. This entire vampire premise is way out there and the same BS keeps happening to Alex Cross. I can usually plow through his books in a weekend, and I have had this one on my nightstand for well over a month. I read only a few chapters at a clip. This means I am BORED! I am so disappointed with this one. Wait until it comes out in paperback so you won't have to pay as much or better yet, borrow it. Save your money on this one. Maybe his next book will be back up to par.

"This one has it all!: This book and 'Bride of Dreams' are my two favourite Hodge books so far (I haven't read them all yet!). I only recently discovered this author and as a Georgette Heyer fan I really enjoy Hodge too. This book is particularly good because it doesn't fall into the trap of putting historical details before story (as many of Hodge's books do). It has a good plot, great characters (including an unusually young hero who is about 22 I think), and, as the title suggests, a lot of adventure. The romance is nice but not sickly. A very enjoyable book.

"Another disappointed reader: I won't repeat what other reviewers have written, but I was very disappointed in this book. Since it was marketed to Sherlock Holmes readers, I expected some resemblance between the plot / characters and the original Doyle works. Instead, I got overblown horror, a romance for Holmes, artificial dialogue, and basically a run of the mill horror story into which two unrecognizable characters named Holmes and Watson have been inserted. It might have been an OK horror book on its own, but it's misleading to market this book as any kind of continuation of or homage to the Sherlock Holmes series.

"Best Cross Pen refill available: I have used this pen consistently for the last two years since inheriting my father's Cross pen.

This is the first refill I've needed since owning this pen (moderate use over two years). Can't recommend this strongly enough.

It is buried in the kids and babies section, though its clean, simple lines make it a basic accessory for any bathroom. The ones officially for adults that I found are metal, unpleasantly ornate, and more expensive.

"For xtreme dieters only: Really wanted to love this set, even with the relatively muted colors, but it is practically impractical. The dinner plate is indeed 10"" round, but nearly half of its width is taken up by the very wide, slanted, fluted rim. This leaves a flat surface of only about 5.5"" wide for cutting on or eating off of. A chicken leg couldn't lie flat on it. The salad plate is similarly proportioned, and the cereal bowl holds only about 1 cup, or 8 fluid ounces. Try eating your breakfast out of the 1-cup measuring cup in your kitchen drawer! If you are looking to cut your portions to 1/2 of itty-bitty, this set might be perfect for you; but otherwise, you'll be going back for 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, and still have leftovers....

The beginning of 'The Deposition' roused my interest a little, and I was hopeful that there would be a worthwhile story beyond the opening chapter. I was to be sadly disappointed. Despite increasing boredom, I plodded on, hopeful that things would improve, but was disappointed at the end. And those dreadful footnotes...

"Novice Hendrix buyers, BEWARE!: It seems strange that Experience Hendrix/MCA chose this show as an official release over some other great shows (Royal Albert Hall '69, Berkeley '70, Monterey '67). For Hendrix fans, it is about time they finally get a complete official release of this show. But for first time buyers, don't let a fancy marketing campaign and nice packaging fool you. While this concert has some inspired moments and some brilliant guitar work, overall it is a very strained, sloppy, and uninspired performance by Hendrix. Experienced fans of Hendrix will see past the flaws and marvel at the brilliance, but for you first time buyers exploring Hendrix for the first time, consider other releases first. Unfortunately Experience Hendrix/MCA has not released many live albums yet , so the safest bet is the BBC Sessions release.

I bought this based on performance, then price, and I've had success in getting good quality output. The problem is that there's no product documentation, and the software controller is a fragmented, five-part program from a separate provider that isn't integrated with the hardware. And it doesn't have user support or even an upgrade path.If this was still 2004, it would be acceptable to anyone with the abundant time to cobble all the pieces together to get it to work.

"The Painted View: The Painted View by Matthew Louis Burns is a tenderly absurd 420 page tale of benign intervention. Humanity is confronting extinction, a downward spiral linked to nanotechnology and biotechnology endeavor. The European Union is resistant, effectively undermining the needs of its citizens. Politics is increasingly out of touch. Sexuality lingers suspect in a world acutely out of balance. One man battles against seemingly impossible odds to contribute and make a difference.Following six years of production, Burns delivers to his readers this witty, satirical romance. This heart-breaking narrative is an exercise in reflection exposing the beauty of life rich in trial and tribulation, adversity and opportunity.The Painted View is a curiously crafted adventure certain to entertain and inspire.

The maps are large and have a good sense of scale.That being said, the graphics are unpolished and ugly, which creates a BIG problem for a flight sim, in that it's hard to gauge distance because the terrain textures are uniformly flat and boring.The audio is surpisingly good. The com chatter and background music are exceptional.If the developers had had another few months to touch this game up it might've been an excellent outing. As it is, strategy minded flight-sim enthusiasts only need apply.This is not a game you want to spend over 10 dollars for, in my opinion.

"Quality way below expectation: During extensive testing of the lens on a Canon Xsi (12MP) I found the lens to be very sharp in the center of the picture on all zoom levels, but the edge of the lens was quite another matter.All the pictures were taken at 1/40 f4.5 ISO 400. At 24 mm the vignetting (darker corners) is very noticeable. The lens is also quite soft outside the center of the photo.

"It's early yet, but...: I have only used this mug a handful of times (it's a recent purchase), but so far I have no major problems with it. I brew coffee in the morning and pour it into the mug on my way out the door. Here's the thing:I drive a motorcycle to work. I toss the mug full of coffee into a saddlebag and ride about 11 miles, accelerating, braking, leaning side to side, going over bumps and jolts. By the time I get to work, the mug has been tossed all around and is laying on its side, but not a single drop spilled. Of course, the first two times I did this, I put the mug in a ziploc bag to be safe. Both times, the mug and bag were dry as a bone, so I stopped bothering with the bag. The seal is THAT good.There have been complaints about how long it keeps drinks hot. Yeah, it's not all that long. Maybe an hour after I get to work, the coffee (if there's any left) is somewhere slightly above lukewarm. So I took off a star for that. Otherwise, no complaints.

"A COMPLETE waste of money.: I'll try to keep this short-My play and charge kit is not even a year old, it's around 8 months. It will not hold a charge anymore. You can plug it in to have it say it's charging, let the light turn green (which means it's fully charged), then you unplug the chord and the controller dies instantaneously.I don't recommend this product to anyone.It's more inconvenient but you're much better off with rechargeable AA batteries, they'll at least last you for more than a few months. Before I bought the play and charge kit I used those for about 5 years, the only problem that would occur is if the controller would die mid-game.

If this is Pocket Books' relaunch for ""Voyager,"" it's stalled on the pad.Christie Golden's text is insipid. She never delves too intimately into the characters' thoughts, feelings and actions. Descriptions of the various mileau are bare-bones. It's a carcass with nothing edible.Several storylines are wrapped up surprisingly quickly, and it's too bad. Many fans were disappointed with how the TV episode of ""Endgame"" concluded. They wanted to know ""what happened next"" to their favorite characters. Unfortunately, even 100 pages into ""Homecoming,"" it's less than satisfying. I was surprised by how ""quick and dirty"" everything was. It was like a ""Voyager"" episode trying to sneak past a previously established plot point just to tell another story.Well, on second thought, maybe this ""relaunch"" is right on track after all ...

"Excellent for cystic acne!!!: This stuff works great for cystic acne. Whenever I feel one coming on, I'll dab some of this on it and within 2-3 days the cyst is gone. The only downside is that it's tinted so I only use it at night. Very inexpensive and definitely worth at try!

"Use To Extend the Charge Cable for YOUR Verizon Iphone: I HATED the short length of the charger that came with Iphone! Is Apple on drugs?? My outlets are so low on my walls I was almost in the FLOOR trying to charge the phone! THIS product is what you need to extend your charge cable! Use the outlet converter that came with the original Apple cord on one side of this cord, plug the Iphone charger cord into the other side of the cord and plug the dock into your phone. Very handy for making it long enough to reach a side table by your recliner or bed. The gold connectors are ALWAYS the best way to go when buying ANY after market connectors because they help preserve the integrity of your original cords capability. Yes I broke this down very simply because if my neice can understand what I just wrote, everyone who reads it will be able to also.

"Best ""mouse""... ever: I have to say that I have been using this product (and it's previous version) for 15 years now. Starting as a student with a messy desk, and now a professional with a messy desk, it is great not having to make room for a mouse. Being in an office for most of the day and playing computer games at night I have had no problems with wrist or arm pains. I have had to buy a few of these over the years because the buttons stick or stop working, but I think that that is normal for mice. When they do I just go down to a local store or order one online.The only drawback I see with these is that logitech hasn't updated it in years. The standard these days with gaming mice is to have more buttons for gameplay options. I have 2 fingers that could click buttons to the right of the normal mice buttons.

"It was a dreadful let down: I was disappointed with this having two of my favorite movie actors Jimmy Stewart & Maureen O'Hara. It was a horrible let down. This does not fall in to the movies I love. This is not a family or Christian friendly film. It takes the Lords name in vain. Along with drinking, smoking, & adult family problems. What little humor it does have most teens would not understand it and no preteen would understand it. If you are looking for a family movie this is not it.

"It can't get any worse than this!: I went out and bought this cd and found $15 of my money totally wasted. What this cd needs is musicality and not someone who can't sing and desperately needs singing lessons screaming in my ear. Since the music (I shouldn't say music I should say trash) disapointed me I read the lyrics thinking maybe I would find some meaning. The lyrics were totally average and dull. I am not one to complain but this is the worse cd I have ever heard in my entire life!!! As a fellow musician I see this as a disgrace to the industry. In my opinion, either save your money or buy a good rock cd like Bush, Sublime, or Matchbox 20.

"don't buy it!: Based on the rave reviews I purchased this book. I am minoring in Italian and wanted a grammar that went into more detail than the very good, but basic one I own (Essential Italian Grammar Olga Ragusa). I have to agree with the other reviewer here who stated that this is not an easily accessible book. Like the other reviewer I too am near fluent in two other languages and already have a background in Italian. The book is not well organized, and though loaded with examples, few were of the kind that proved helpful in shedding light on the language in a way that improved my understanding of the nuances of usage. It is so poorly put together that I too am planning to toss it in the Goodwill bag, and look for another grammar book.

"Great movie, awful DVD: This movie has intense sentimental value to me, since I grew up with it as a child. When I discovered is was available on DVD I lept for joy and quickly baught it. However my joy has quickly fallen to disapointment. This is a pathetic DVD, no better then the VHS, from which I think it was transfered. Pan & Scan with a stereo audio track. The film is extreemly grainy and full of scratches. MGM is notorious for making horrible DVDs, and this is a classic example. Secret of NIMH isn't that old of a movie, I find it hard to believe they couldn't find an original print to do a good transfer from, rather then just copying the VHS. I sincerely hope they reevaluate this release and give us a remastered widescreen version in the future.

"An important work: Some works on the Celts are almost pure archeology, others border on new age rubbish while still others use the writing of the classical Mediterranean authors whose works are not only full of contradictions but were written for the audience of the times they were written as a type of political propaganda. Rankin is a scholar who bridges these gaps and offers a level headed approach to the Celts who came in contact with the classical world. Authoritative and reliable.A must for the Celtophile.

I finally gave up hope when 90% of the book was read that there was no twist, no exciting turn of events, no scandal. Just a predictable ""day in the life"" story of a fast rising tort lawyer.Grisham still writes in a fast paced witty way & always manages to spin the perfect compelling character. That was the only saving grace.Bottom Line: Don't expect too much and you might not be disappointed. This is NOT ""The Firm"".

"Check it out: This album goes straight to the heart of true country fans. Tommy Wood's music has a notable traditional foundation, and the lyrical topics cover a variety of territory. I Tripped Over Your Memory is clever and fun. By You Down By the Bayou is also. Both are 'sing along' material. The Book is a powerful story of a young man's struggle to be his own man, yet aching for his father to be proud of him. It is an emotional tug-of-war that many people struggle with in becoming independent. Other songs on this album touch on a variety of topics that are easy to relate to. This album is definitely worth checking out.

I have it hooked onto the strap of the camcorder bag for myCanon VIXIA HFS10. The cloth pulls easily out of the pouch, and can be stuffed back in simply with a thumb. I use it mostly to wipe of the LCD screen which tends to get smudged with finger grease pretty quickly. Works great for me.

"A Big Hit!: I purchased this CD as a Christmas gift for my father and, as soon as we finished opening our Christmas gifts, he had it on the CD player. He had recently seen Jack Jones in concert and he said that he sounds the same in person as he does on his recordings. He has been a fan since Jack Jones was in the height of his popularity so this CD was definitely a big hit. The only problem with this purchase was that the CD case was cracked when I received it, so I had to buy an empty CD case to replace the damaged one. Other than that, this was definitely a good choice for my Dad, who, truly is, one of those people who fits the description of ""a man who has everything,"" that is, everything he needs and/or wants anyway!

"Compilation 3 means more variety: Having the Urban Rebounder and the first two compilations just wetted my appetite to see the other types of workouts available in the series. Compilation 3 is also fun, effective, and something I will use to keep exercising without boredom. Kick Bound is led by the vivacious Traci. A little shorter (24 minutes) you will still work up a sweat. Interval Bound is just fantastic as it gives a good workout with a great variety of moves that are easy to follow. Hi-Lo will remind anyone old enough of your aerobics classes from the mid 80's thorugh mid 90's. Latin Bound was not for me, too slow paced and short to be a good workout.

"It felt preachy: I started looking into natural child birth methods realizing that natural medicine and conventional medicine often butt heads, but I was surprised at how bitter the author is towards conventional medicine. I had a general idea of what I was trying to avoid in a doctor and the hospital I am going to give birth in, but she honestly scared me. I also have to say that a few of the things she said have no scientific basis or are outright wrong. I was looking for a book that just explained what the Bradley method was and advantages to the method. This was not the book. There are sections that explain the method, but they are relatively few and far between and she tends to be very condescending of any other method out there. I like the general idea behind the method, but this book was a real turn-off for me. I would suggest Ina May's book, it actually has useful information in the second half and isn't nearly so scary.

"Bland, Recycled Advice; Better Options Available: This is not a bad book, yet much of the wisdom is very similiar to Wayne Dyer and other pop psychologists. Dick Sutphen's superb ""Reinventing Yourself"" is a much better choice.

Someone new to reading psychology books will probably be impressed with this work, I observed strong similarities to Dyer, Nathaniel Branden, and others in McGraw's book. Now his son has authored his own self-help book so this has become a family franchise.

"Perfcet Fit for Saw, plus room for storage: Fits for Husqvarna Rancher (295 I think) with a 49cc motor and 20"" bar perfectly! I also have spare chains, chain sharpener, safety equipment, and 2 stoke oil in the case. Plus the square design allows for easy storing, I can stack stuff on it easy where stihls round top does not. Great buy for me!!!

"good value given you don't have to drive to get them: The title of my review pretty much says it all. Sure, you can get these cheaper at some retailers, but if you make a special trip (not all stores carry these), you just spent more money than if you bought them on Amazon.

"Safety: I bought this because it looked so comfy, but my husband and I took the car seat to our local fire station to make sure we had installed it correctly and were told that these were not recommended because they interfere with the harness. The kind that go completely over the carriers are recommended. We returned ours. Safety first.

"Darker and Subtler Tale than Christmas Carol: Dickens crafts another dark yet hopeful Christmas tale here. Redlaw is a better developed and subtler character than Ebenezer Scrooge, and his visit with a spirit -- and the results of that visit -- are arguably more heartbreaking. Scrooge learned his lesson by looking in on those people he knew and watching their lives undetected. Redlaw only realizes his mistake once he has inflicted suffering on many more than just himself. There's a clear lesson to the story, but it's a little more interesting than the I found in A Christmas Carol Most everyone knows the importance of being kind to others, but not everyone would think -- or even agree -- that bad memories are an important part of being human.

"Something a little different: From the time I first started shaving, and I'm 51, I've always used a Norelco. The head on this shaver is a little thinner and that is taking some getting used to. I do like the shaver as it gives a very close shave, and when you're done you drop it in the cleaning module, lock it in and away it goes. It cleans, lubricates the shaver, and even leaves it smelling pleasant. Nice shaver, and a good gift.

"The Perfect Guide to Episodes 6-11: Though they'll be spanned between 6 books, these complete guides to Cowboy Bebop are perfect for the person who wants a detailed summary of each episode and information on the Cowboy Bebop world. Volume 2 picks up where Volume 1 left off, giving in-depth summaries of episodes 6-11(with clear pictures along side the writting) and information on the ships and characters in these episodes. Also, there are facts and 'secrets' within the pages, explaining the reasons for episode titles, events in the episodes, character pictures and items, and also the director's name of each show. This is a masterfully designed book filled with information on Cowboy Bebop, and although it is a relatively thin book, it covers most aspects of each episode a lot better than you'd think. I recommend it to any Cowboy Bebop fan. Its not very expensive, so cough up the money and buy this perfect little guide to episodes 6-11.

"Bad Movie Made Worse: Troma doesn't really know their target audience. Seems to me they take perfectly sleazy movies and cut out most of the sleaze. I refuse to believe the director of Rabid Grannies would have filmed copious amounts of cheesy gore simply to have every scrap of it edited out. Troma's claim that this is the ""director's cut,"" is a load of fiber. It's almost as if they cut out all the gore so they could fill up their ""EXTRAS"" area. I suggest avoiding it.

They remain a paper weight, without function or use. Selling these books was tantamount to theft.

You'd expect me, your friendly neighborhood sarcastic teenager, to love this album.You are wrong, buddy. This is the very definition of bad music. People might argue, ""It embraces four styles of music!"" to which I say, phaw. The Beatles' White Album uses surf music, reggae, country/western, protometal, blues, folk, rock and avant-garde. That's eight styles right there.Avoid it like the plague, especially Hot In Herre, the Creed song, and the No Doubt song.

"Hummingbird makes great Fish Finders: This fish finder and temperature system is fantastic for an economical alternative to the more expensive ones. I have always been impressed with Hummingbird and I wasn't disapointed this time either. The display is big enoughj and flexible enough to show the fish at the right depth. The temp function was a little confusing though. It appeared by the extra plug in th eback of the display that I would need another sensor and cable, but the temp started reading right from the beginning, so it uses the existing cable and sensors. It was just hard to tell that until I got it in the water and it worked. I would recommend this system for anyone looking for a SIMPLE, economical system. I am very pleased with it.

"Decent reference, some quality issues.: I love this book as a reference. Yes the Internet is an option but getting the information from a trusted source makes me feel better. The only issue I have is with the quality of the pictures. The labels in some of the pictures are missing. Most notably in the plumbing chapter. If you have a decent idea of what you're trying to accomplish this isn't a big deal. If you aren't good with following directions and like pictures you might have issues.

"Simple in its own Profound Way: This is one of the most under-rated phenomenology books available. On first read it appears simplistic, but this is both its charm and power. Phenomenology is not complex - it is very simple. It is seeing (or hearing etc) what is there - before any interpretation. And this is perhaps the difficult part - engaging with things without intepreting them.This book must be re-read and then it can be mindblowing. And many of todays 'stars' - like Hillman and Sardello owe van den Berg a large debt. Also try his other books, particularly 'Changing Nature of Man' and 'Divided Existence and Complex Society'.

You need only two to take it down though. Excellent shelter once it is standing. Also easy to lug around as stored in case with wheels

"Excellent: This double live cd shows DTB at their finest. The band's singer, the recently added Mike Mattison, has a great voice and fits in perfectly, but the focus of the band is still on Trucks's amazing slide work. He is truly unlike any other player out there right now. This is a band that's not afraid to be creative and as a result they've done things that are truly unique. This album is an incredible bargain because it contains many new and unheard songs that you won't find on any DTB studio albums. Highlights are ""Volunteered Slavery"" ""Feel So Bad"" ""Joyful Noise"" and ""So Close, So Far Away"", but all of the songs and improvisations are played with great energy and passion.

"has it really been three years?: time is a fickle judge of creativity. i had no idea what i was in for after i released ""peace love beats"". i went back into the studio and decided my next album would not be limited by genre, tempo, or style. i wanted to make something special, a cd full of surprises, and songs that bring out both groove and emotion. this is the end of the 'beats' trilogy, unfortunately, the first album in the series, ""nicotine fits & analogue beats"" is out of print, but Aniligital might re-release it if this album does well. Regardless, I hope that those of you who have been with me thus far as well as those who are new to my music will enjoy this latest offering; it's a trip hop rollercoaster!

"Just... OK: I purchased this book based on some of the older ""rave"" reviews, and was somewhat disappointed. There are some good, basic ideas on meeting management, leadership, etc., but some of them are rather trite (Myers-Briggs typing, etc.) I think this book would be a good starting point to someone in middle management on a project, but if you're beyond this point you may not find anything new.

"Fantasy Lovers Beware: One of my favorite fantasy books of all time was Raymond E Feist's ""A Darkness at Sethanon"".. Unfortunately, my least favorite book is by the same author in the form of ""Rise of the Merchant Prince"".This book is a horrible fantasy book. I wouldn't even call it fantasy. I think history books are more exciting to read. I dreaded every page I read of this book and forced myself to read it because it was part of a series.If stocks, bonds, commerce, waiting on tables, falling in love, raising a family is something you would like to read in excrutiating detail, then this book is definitely for you.However, if you like action, grand adventures, sword fights, sorcery, interesting characters, then stay away from this book.There was not one thing I liked about this book. Feist's worst book to date.

"The best one so far: Easily the best volume of the three Avengers Essentials to date, we now see Rascally Roy Thomas at the scripting helm, along with Awesome John Buscema doing most of the art chores. Say no more! This duo is one of the greatest in comics lore... and even demi-gods Barry [Windsor] Smith and Gene Colan show up to help out on art.This collection contains the spectacular introduction of the Vision, the Avengers vs. the (old) X-Men, several battles with arch-foe Ultron, and the classic Avengers vs. Avengers thanks to the machinations of the time-spanning Scarlet Centurion. I'd give this compilation five stars, but the several issues featuring Hercules and the battles in god-ville are just plain dull. (Avengers #50 featured this crap? YEESH.)

"One of the worst in my opinion...: I bought this album with the bonus tracks a few years ago, thinking it would be somewhere near the quality of No Mean City. It was not, sadly, and has since collected dust for years. It is not only just a bad Nazareth album, but reeks of early 1980's pop sound and horrible mixing. Manny's guitar doesn't even feel like it is even there, I cannot even now try to remember a song off of it because all the songs loaded on this corpse sound like generic radio friendly classic rock. That is the only word that really describes the listening experience of this record: GENERIC. No soul found in the playing or singing. At least when compared to a classic album like Expect No Mercy, so I encourage fans to really consider this purchase because to this day regret still lingers round my soul. Maybe I will just sell it on here, and end these painful negative feelings inside.

This is an excellent resource for those who are planning on, or even considering, using ""alternative"" methods to fight cancer.

"One of Culture Club's Best Albums: When Culture Club reunited in the late 80's there was much fanfare in the United States. A tour, a new episode of Behind the Music and talks of a new album. For some reason, the ""new album"" was never released in the United States. Many times when groups of yester year reunite the magic is gone. Not so with Culture Club. ""Don't Mind If I Do,"" is one of their best albums. Content wise, it is right up there with Kissing to Be Clever. My favorite song on the album is the reggae inspired, ""I Want To Be Loved."" This is a great song. Other singles from this album include the reggae inspired ""Your Kisses Are Charity,"" and another song named ""Cold Shoulder."" It's beyond me to guess why this album wasn't released in the states but if you get a chance, check out this album. The videos are great too, they can be found on the greatest hits DVD.

"excellent screenwriting tool...: This is the ultimate example for the penniless screenwriter/filmmaker to work from. That's the amazing thing, this could've been made by Joe Independent if he was so inclined. Stick a guy on an island for four years, the only other cast member is a volleyball, and chart his progress. You'd have to dump the big-budget plane crash, but that stuff can be remedied. What you'd figure would be boring is actually quite captivating. Forging for food, bad tooth, exploring the island, making fire.

"This book is not worthy of the label ""Study Guide."": Being a college student who has years of working experience with computer systems, I was very disappointed with this book. The included CD with the whole text in PDF format, electronic flash cards and exams all sounded great until I realized how many errors the text contained. As I worked through it, I noticed many errors both in the text and with the end-of-chapter review exams. When I would take the exams and get a question wrong, I'd read the answer's explanation which was erroneous, and then I would have to spend time drudging back through some erronous and contradictory text in a futile attempt to find the correct answer. I finally got so frustrated I went to the Sybex website and looked at the errata for the book, and there was quite a bit (about 6 pages worth). In fact, I even found two additional problems which I emailed them about. This text is simply a laughable attempt at a reliable study material.

"Not my thing: I did not like this novel at all. I respect the author's audacity, and I admire his descriptive powers and use of language. Also, the issue of technology and machinery in modern human interactions is an important subject; it's what brought me to the book.The problem is that nothing much happens. I didn't mind the gore or explicit sex; I minded the fact that I didn't care about the characters or the plot. It's a theme-driven novel, and the theme doesn't change or evolve. The descriptions of cars, airplanes, crashes, sexual escapades, drug trips -- they're the same at the start as at the finish. I wanted to grab the author and yell, ""OK, OK, I get it; can we move on now?""The only reason I don't give it 1 star is that Ballard's use of language is great, and his themes are important.

"Written to Fill a Contract Obligation???: This latest Patricia Cornwell novel must have been written by a ghost writer. I cannot believe that the lady that has given us only excellent novels in the past actually wrote this. If Ms. Cornwell actually wrote this novel, she must have been up against a deadline and hadn't been able to come up with new believable ideas for her characters, so she just wrote a joke. The title should have been ""Isle of Dogs: A Farse"". Then, the unsuspecting fan might have had an inkling that they were about to spend money and time on something totally different from Ms. Cornwell's normally excellent mystery novels. This novel had the names of some familiar characters, but this story must have been about their distant country cousins, or perhaps people in a parallel universe where everyone are dopes.

There is this young African-American man in it. He is just a Steppin' Fetchit' for the new millenium. And people think Jarjar Binks was bad. This movie had several Black men in it with good parts. They even laugh at themselves by acknowledging that the young brother is like a ""ghetto smurf."" Still, if this is what Hollywood is providing as parts for young Black men, no wonder there was so much for Spike Lee to criticize in ""Bamboozled.""

But while it's a nice idea, it doesn't work well at all. Having the heating element solely on the bottom means it doesn't cook evenly. No matter what temp I put it on, I never got a good simmer on my soups. I tried roasts in it (surrounded by liquid) on both high and low temperatures, and they came out hard and barely edible.

"The number one album they have made: This is the best one out of all of there albums.This music is along lasting memory that will stay in your mind for quite a while I would like to say.I have this album since it has came out at 96.Still listen to it I usually listen to things tillI am tired of it but I try not to do it with this one so it remains once every morning.Very relaxing when you have the patients for it.

"If you are depressed, don't watch that movie!: I was very curious about that movie everybody is talking about these days. First of all, don't expect a good scenario because there is none, just everyday banalities. This is mostly about the atmosphere surrounding a very boring hotel life in Tokyo, where two people meet and share their loneliness. I wish that movie could have been shot, let's say in Paris. At least the atmosphere would have been more romantic (instead of witnessing those phony disco clowns everywhere) and with a good scenario, would have been more meaningful. Something is missing in that movie and it would be very presumptuous to even think that movie would get an Oscar for best movie, best director etc... Sofia Coppola could have done a lot better with the two very good actors she had (Murray and Johanssen) but, unfortunately the result is very boring and superficial. It's a nice try though...next time maybe...

"Coby: We found the CD player sounds fine, not great just fine, but the radio sounds even worse. This would be a good first radio for a young child. Or if you wanted a radio that needed to be kept in a not so desireable location, in other words you wouldn't feel bad if it got ruined.

"My buddy: Mewtwo is my second favorite Pokemon, next to Mew, and he's so cute! I absolutly love this beanie. I had wanted one for a long time, so I finally decided to buy it at Toys R Us. Along with my electronic Mew figure, he goes everywhere with me, he's sitting on my lap as I type this. He even has a mate (A Mew figure) and two babbies (little Mewtwo figures) Unfourtunatly my five month lab puppy loves this toy as much as I do. She's been after him since we brought her home, and he now has three holes in him thanks to her, and his ''bib'' came unattached on the back, which can happen eaisly. Suki also likes to carry him around in her mouth after she's been digging in the dirt. I wash him about once or twice a week, between my dog messing him up and me spilling things on him, by accident of course. The durabillity really depends on how much you play with it. My sister's is clean and hole free. Still, I couldn't love him more.

"Nice feel and style but doesn't serve its purpose: It looks and feels nice. You won't have any problems navigating around any screen with this. But when it comes down to playing simulation games this pad is useless.This is my first wireless game pad and will be my last. Playing a soccer game for example, every touch is vital. But with this, it cannot receive every push. Even when you have the gamepad right next to the wireless adaptor it won't be able to receive every signal.It's not too bad, but it has denied me a few classic goals which can be very fustrating. As a recommendation, don't buy a wireless gamepad for a few years until they are flawless. It will let you down.

"what a disappointment.: I ordered the book mainly because of the hype i have read about it. I awaited with great anticipation for delivery of this so called ""bible"". Upon delivery I realized how thin and tiny this manual was. I read it immediately and further discovered it is for beginners and offers nothing extraordinary for those wishing to find an edge in this highly competitive and cutthroat business. The contents are simply common sense approaches. Thanks for nothing!

"Not worth the money: I started to read this book without ever having programmer ASP and little idea of how ASP works.

"Cute but poorly made: My son loves Elmo and airplanes. I didn't realize the propellers spin or the eyes moved until recently. It never did it before. Then it was moving all around and my son loved it. About two weeks later, it stopped. It was very disappointing. He has never been able to ride this. He has been too tall for this product since he was 1. Now he just likes us to fly it in the air, to press the buttons, and to hide stuff in the seat.

"Classic: Dilbert is absolutely fantastic and its obscurity is criminal. It's full of hilarious quotes and storylines. It's so dense with jokes, you always find something you missed when you rewatch the series. And you'll do plenty of rewatching if you're anything like me. For anyone unfamiliar with the series, do yourself a favor and watch ""The Knack"" on Hulu. Depending on when you read this review, that particular episode may or may not be available at the moment, but I would argue that it's the best to watch if you get a chance.If you've done that, you've most likely clicked the 'add to cart' button by now.There are two full seasons in the collection, with few special features. Honestly, it doesn't matter. Maybe it would be a tough sell if this show were still on the air and this collection were full price, but as it is, you can't pass it up.

"Horrible range, worse interface, and no help from SMC: Alright, I picked this thing up off of ebay brand new. And I have to say it's been nothing but problems for me. Half the time I can't get any computer to connect to it and recognize it. Then for some inexplicible reason it will stop communicating with the network, requiring to to basically reinstall all the stuff on your computer, lug the printer and the server down to your computer and plug it all in and redo it from scratch. Now that doesn't even work on the thing. So I've got a paperweight. SMC's tech support is even worse, assuming you can understand anyone there, which I could barely do.All around I've found this product to be less then thrilling in its usefulness. I'm done with it and SMC. The worst slap in the face from this whole thing is that on my box is says limited lifetime warrenty. But somehow my server is out of warrenty? Yeah... I'm done with em and this. It's in the trash tomorrow.

"Excellent Bass: First off I would like to say that this is the only set of headphones that can handle the bass of the music I'm playing. Even expensive home stereo speakers can't handle the amount of bass that I have my EQ set at. The only reason for giving it a 4 star is because they aren't very adjustable. Don't get me wrong because they are comfortable it's just that it doesn't conform perfectly with my one ear. Everyone has slightly different ears from one another. I just wish they could be more adjustable. There are No instructions other than a picture overview on the back of the package. I'm actually afraid to bend the earpiece because I don't know if will bend of just break. Other than that they are great sounding headphones.

"Not what we had hoped: We bought this for the kid, thinking it would be a fun holiday special with a classic character. We didn't realize it was made as recently as it was, and as such, it lacked some of the nostalgia for us. It seemed to have more zip and lack the same innocence the old Yogi cartoons had. More importantly, though, it didn't really hold our son's interest. About 10 minutes into it he was more interested in going to play with toys in the other room.If you're a Yogi die hard, and a fan of the new movie, this may be up your alley. If you're looking for the older style nostalgic type show, pass on this and go to something like The Easter Bunny is Coming to Town, or Here Comes Peter Cottontail.

"Blair Witch Deja Vu: If you did not like 'The Blair Witch Project' you probably will not like this one either. It's an agonizingly slow burning candle if, like me, you're an empiricist and don't believe one iota in an unverifiable supernatural world. In fact it will quickly seem contrived and quite silly. In fact, the relationship between the two principals was more interesting than all the boogieman stuff. Their 'partnership' was downright annoying. It struck me as uncomfortably modern, without real affection and fraught with the certainty of future dysfunctionality. You will probably hate yourself the morning-after if you spend money to watch this decidedly unscary effort. Lary9

"Better than you would expect it to be!: I thought this movie was just another of those cheesy movies with just a bunch of big boobs and no story what so ever, but it's not that exactly. There are a ton of big boobs, but it actually has a pretty good story to it. The story is the main reason why it was better than expect.The story is about, how average guys can get hot girls. But, the story also goes further by having a group of girls that has made a mission to finding guys that can give them what they want and spend all their money on them for sex, and guys that cannot do this end up on a blacklist. Then, this other group of guys want to be able to get these hot girls and have a leader name Johnny to show them how to do this. Both groups learn about each other at the end and it kind of all works out at the end.

"Quite possibly, the worst book I've ever read: This was assigned to me in college 25 years ago. I still remember how I struggled to get through the 90 some pages of this book. One reviewer wrote that the point wasn't to tear down men, but to show that women can live without men. She must have missed the part where because me are gone, so are wars. Clearly only men can be greedy/hateful. Women are only nurturing and giving. This book was assigned along with ""The Handmaid's Tale"" by Margaret Atwood. I can't say enough good things about THAT book.

"Step into the sideshow, youll be glad you did: I heard about these guys on a site where some of my favorite metal bands where listed, so I downloaded ""Falling Down"" which I thought was very well done, and my brother ordered the cd for me. It was diffrent for what I thought they would be like, songs like ""Wither Away"", ""Power Tool"" and ""Drown"" were not what I was expecting in this Album, which is good, these are some of my favorite songs. Max Illidge has a unique voice, and he does a lot with it, and the choruses are good too. This is their major label release that has some tracks of their previous albums, if you like these guys, definitely check out their other stuff.If you haven't heard of them, step into the sideshow, you'll be glad you did.

So, I decided to give it a try...All the claims they make on TV are true! Everything I cook in it turns out delicious, tender and juicy. I am a true convert and I would highly recommend this rotisserie to everyone.It is easy to use and easy to clean. I put aluminum foil on the drip pan on the bottom and the reflector for the heating elements. This makes it very easy to clean.But the best part is the way the food comes out.

"Greatest album ever, and that's an understatement: This album gives me the chills everytime I listen to it.

"Remember Me: First of all I will be honest and admit my only reason for watching this film was because it stars Robert Pattinson (Edward from Twilight.) But now I know that even if it didn't, it would still be a worthwhile film to see. It deals with serious issues, and tells the story of Tyler whose parents are divorced, and whose dad has provided everything materially, but has never been there emotionally for him or his younger sister. Tyler is somewhat reckless, who lets his temper get the best of him at times, which ultimately gets him into trouble. It deals with family tragedy, the bullying of his little sister at school, his falling in love, and just basically his relationships with everyone he knows. It makes you think, and realize to value the time you have with those you love. I recommend seeing it.

"A Big Joke......: As someone who is very familiar with the true story of Kenneth Bianchi, the famed serial killer nicknamed The Hillside Strangler, I was very excited to see this movie in my local video store and rented it right away. A truly disappointing movie. This movie gets very boring with us seeing a psychiatrist interviewing Bianchi and trying to understand his mind and why he killed so many women. This movie should not even fall into the horror catagory as it provides us no horror but just boredom. For someone who would like to see the true story of Bianchi, I would suggest viewing Serial Killers... the 3 DVD set. In it, we get to see the real Kenneth Bianchi and the real story of the multiple murders he commited. I recommend no one waste their time viewing this movie for it provides no real insite into the mind of The Hillside Strangler.

They're pretty stupid in the book - just kill one guy, then go and kill the other.I wasn't able to read this book before because it was too boring, and then I picked it up again and started reading it. I have no idea what Yomin Carr was supposed to be doing, nor what Nom Anor is trying to do. It just doesn't make sense.Maybe this book fell short of my expectations, but I think it's due to the fact that it was ringed with a lot of hype. It's just a new series!

I prefer the shorter books like MacDonald used to write.I think the author planned on this being the start of a series featuring his hero but it doesn't seem to have taken place as yet.Worth a read if you like the gumshoe detective-type books (which I do).

"Disappointing: As a loyal Lyle fan from many years back I was ecstatic to hear that he had a new album, and when I saw the song list I was even more excited. The excitement ended when I played the CD the first time, and hasn't been rekindled with subsequent replays. For the first time ever I'm hearing Lyle with absolutely no soul - it's like he was walking through the recording sessions, without ever getting really involved with the music. The only track I like is the Toy Story theme with Randy Newman, and that's because Randy comes across so well on it. To me the CD is a huge disappointment - if you find it in a used CD bin at a greatly reduced price, you may want to check it out for yourself. My advice: Save your CD dollars for another time, and maybe even another artist.

"Headphones that are good at what they do: These headphones are good:Comfortable (although not fully-circumaural; they may still press on your ears a bit)Decent sound quality (but very bass-heavy, don't listen to the online reviews which tout it as 'faithfully reproducing music', these aren't studio-quality headphones)Microphone is of above-average qualityNice thick, long-enough cordThey look damn cool (dunno if I'd use them in public though :x)All in all a very good headset

"This poor, poor book: This poor, poor book is dying to be a movie. It's just struggling to exist as a novel on a bookshelf when it has been deformed by a few significant major-motion-picture-style characteristics. First, the text is littered with trivial detail. Second, there is an abundance of dialogue. (These two combined make some pages read like parts of a script, stage directions and lines.) Third, the graphic sex. Fourth, the lack of a single defining plot point. The premise of the book is extremely clever, diligently crafted abd explained and well-held, but the horrifically expository writing (think the first fifteen pages of any Baby Sitter's Club novel) distracts from the central ideas and questions the book should raise. Not to mention that Niffenegger's theme of comparing her two characters to Odysseus and Penelope is presumptuous and downright cocky!

"Could've been great: Godzilla (1998) is a movie that really frustrated me in that it doesn't have any depth to it at all; it plays out like some video game with special effects with a weak and elementary script. There's no darkness to this movie, nor is there much seriousness, doom or suspense. The overall mood of the film is very light, which makes it a laughable experience overall. I thought that the story of Godzilla was supposed to be darker; it lacks the elements of a similar franchise, King Kong. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. The second star is for special effects. Sorry I have to be so honest :-)

"In-House Bio, Only So-So: This is a very ordinary in-house biography of the legendary street writer Donald Goines. The book came out shortly after Goines's death (in 1974) and was commissioned by his very own publisher (Holloway House), likely as a means of capitalizing on their star author's underground fame.Some corporate bias is evident here, with the biographer Eddie Stone extolling Holloway House's role in Goines's life. Moreover, Stone's glossing of each novel's plot can get tiresome -- it's like having to listen to a high-school book report on Kenyatta when in fact you'd rather just read about Kenyatta himself.Check out Eddie Allen's more recent Low Road (2004) for a far more balanced account of Goines's life.

"Great Device for Home Exercise: I bought this unit after some nasty health problems. I wasn't sure if I'd ever get back to the physical condition I was in before, but now I'm working to go beyond where I was. Having this unit in my home saves valuable time compared to going to a gym. The workouts are very effective. I don't think you can buy a better exercise device for the price.

"Prem, I wish you had started writing sooner!: While a student at Marquette Dental School and while involved in activities there through the years, I knew Prem Sharma as a consummate professional and gentleman. When I learned that he had published a novel, I bought it out of curiousity and was prepared to be disappointed. No need! Prem has written a novel which I could not put down- wonderfully moving as well as informative. This book is a must read for anyone seeking positive, uplifting, and inspirational prose. Congratulations Prem! I only wish you had started writing sooner.

"Small Choices Beget Monumental Consequences: Making Choices is the story of the Dutch Resistance to their Nazi occupiers during the second world war. It is a fascinating illumination of the stories of four actual members of the resistance, surviving seemingly impossible odds. Both humorous and poignant, Making Choices surprises us with monumental, yet unusual, quirky aspects of this largely unknown story. Highly recommended.

"Fine, portable lightbox: This is a great, little light box. It is lightweight, portable, slender, and lovely to hold. However, it could certainly benefit from a stronger light source.

"So much for just trying to get away from it all...: This book is almost set up as two short stories, the first being on the ship/island where Lola and Max get to know each other, and the second back home where they join forces to take down an unauthorized internet site being run by Lola's ex.Lola is a former bulimic model turned healthy lingerie business owner. The book takes a realistic look at Lola's bulimia and her struggle to recover. Max is a security consultant/undercover operative having a really bad day when he meets Lola by commandering the boat she's sleeping on to get away from drug lords who want him dead. Oh yeah, she has her yippy dog, Baby Doll, along with her.Lola and Max have inner demons to face as well as real live bad guys (the drug lord and her ex). They face them together and fall in love in the process. A fun read for the summer.

I take it to work with me every day, I can carry my lunch and gym clothes in it, it fits in the trunk of my motorcycle, and holds everything neatly, with plenty of room. If this one ever wears out, I'll surely get another. It's definitely worth the price.

"nice guys finish last: not only are they one of the only truly 'fresh' hip-hoppish acts, they're the kind of guys who might have educated the youth instead of making them dumber with every record. as I understand it they're broken up now.. fighting the man was too strenuous and being more artists than politicos they chose to move on with different groups. too bad, and the corporate executives (I'll never buy another Dean Martin record, not that he cares) who chose to cripple these mad, original geniuses have also crippled the souls of all the kids who may never really appreciate the crooners of yesterday. Why do they do that, every single time? A tiny Dean Martin sample and they want either billions in royalties or the death of the record label that dared allow such a record to be produced: no wonder people don't feel guilty for sharing files. Up with leisure suits, down with lawsuits!

"Brita has lost the plot: I dropped my old Brita, which was great, and bought this one at the market. What a crock. When you fill it, water leaks through the handle. And then, every time you try to pour or move it, the lid falls off. I am reminded a dozen times a day what a piece of junk this is. Super irritating. What could have happened to the design department of a company for it to go from great to disaster so quickly? And that no one caught it in testing? Weird. Avoid their products at all costs.

"Wasteful Treasures: On a scale of 1 to 5 stars, this item deserves a -10. Yes, it's that bad. I bought this item for my sister for Christmas as a way to steer my nieces from that buttery microwaveable mess they get in the box to a more healthier regimen. The only healthy thing about this popcorn maker was the fact that you could eat the kernels raw because they didn't pop! I poured in the amount as I was instructed and as my nieces and I waited excitedly to hear the poping sound, nothing happend. The machine started fine and the kernels were turning, then one kernel popped. After that one popcorn, the machine stopped. After 20 minutes it turned itself on again and popped another. After another 20 minutes the fan turned on again and the rest of the kernels burned (without popping). Needless to say, this burncorn maker was definetly a waste of time and effort. I would have more success popping the kernels outside in the sun during Boston's winter season.

"BOR-ING!: Meant to be a copy of The Matrix and similar ""sci fi"" movies, i guess. To me, not much is dumber than a special effects movie in which the special effects are totally unconvincing -- like this. Very little plot, just an intro used as an excuse for another chase movie. Everything is blue, for some reason (another irritating affectation). No daylight ever appears, everyone and everything is blue. WHY? also, the ""futuristic"" cars and street scenes look hokier than Star Trek of 1968. Could not sit through it.

"It Did Not Deserve 1 Star: Yes, there were some distant shots, and yes it will not win any awards, but it is a live concert, and it does have some great songs. MP helped start the Salsa/Merengue Revolution, so I am giving them extra stars out of respect. Although I can understand why the other reviewer was disappointed. He had higher expectations which I can certainly understand. I agree with his suggestion regarding the other DVD, and I would also like to be so bold as to recommend the Feliciano DVD/CD, or the Ragga Nacion DVD/CD. The Feliciano DVD/CD has Celia Cruz's last video on it.

"Title should be some songs from the movie, not the Soundtrack: The movie had more than 30 songs in it. The CD has about one-half that amount and omits many of the best songs. Also, I have searched, played the movie in slow mode and checked out nearly every song listed in the credits but I cannot find the song that plays at the end through the beginning of the credits. No one seems to know. Can someone please tell me what it is and where to find it? It has a whistle in in it and one chorus keeps talking about ""here we come to get you"". Very much appreciate anyone that can demonstrate their genius by telling me the name of the song and/or the artist. Many thanks.

There were always problems with packet loss, latency and connection stability.

Anyone serious about their networking should avoid this product like the plague!

"A few good stories: Maybe I have completely different tastes than the editors of this anthology, or maybe there just wasn't a whole lot of excellent fantasy published in 2003 but I found Year's Best Fantasy 4 to be a hit and miss affair. Many of the stories are decent but nothing special. A few are pretty bad. Even the usually reliable Neil Gaiman has a misfire with the dull ""Closing Time."" Kelly Link's ""Catskin"" is just plain bizarre (but I suspect it's supposed to be). Among the few excellent stories are the Nebula Award winner ""Basement Magic"" by Ellen Klages, a clever update on the fairy-godmother story;One Thing About the Night"" by Terry Dowling, a creepy ghost story involving a mirrored room; and ""Dragon's Gate"" by Pat Murphy, a well-told high-fantasy quest adventure. There are also some good stories by Lucius Shepard and Terry Bisson. I should also mention the editor's introductions to the stories often contain plot spoilers so I recommend reading those after reading the story.

"Money Well Spent.: To me, 4KaST's album had it's highs and it's lows. But the better parts of the album overshine the bad. The song's seem to pick up on a vibe, whether it be the lonely or lighthearted side that you're feeling, there's something in there for all kinds of moods. They sing from their heart, and it's rare to find a group to convey emtions across so strong. In my honest opinion this cd is well worth the money.

Madazzaland being the greater of the two, this cd continues to inspire more and more fans as time moves on. Although it wasn't an initial success, it has developed a huge respect and almost cult following among Duranies. Duran Duran continue to be a truely under-rated rock band. Hopefully with more albums of this caliber the public will see them for the talent they are.

"Essential birdwatching reading: For any active birdwatcher who goes beyond their backyard this volume is essential reading. Connor writes in a lively, entertaining, but also very educational style. Chapter on optics will be very helpful for beginners, but probably best are his chapters on various bird groups where individual species can be difficult to learn (I especially like the chapters on warblers, hawks, and shorebirds). Out of the multitude of birdwatching books available there are few, if any, that fill quite the same intermediate niche as this volume does so well. Warning: there are no color pictures or photos here for those especially interested in such, but this now classic instructive text is well worth the price for avid birders.

"Horner should stick to academic writing: Stiff writing, a predictable plot, one dimensional characters, this was not a lot of fun to plod through. Unlike psychiatrist and fiction writer Irvin Yalom, whose novel ""Lying on the Couch"" at least had a plot, humor, and vivid characters, Horner has not been able to successfully make the transition from academic writing to writing novels. Horner may have an excellent grasp of psychoanalytic theory and the dynamics underlying the psychotheraputic process, but her novel is an utter bore.

"A must-have for car camping!: Oh, how I love my coffee in the morning! I bought this when a group of us decided to head out on a car-camping trip . . . After reading the reviews and the instructions, I tested the percolator on my stove for a few days. I made several full pots, turned the heat down when the water boiled, and my Pete's coffee tasted better than expected.I really appreciated the percolator on the trip. Another camper had a cool espresso gadget, but we had to wait in line to get a cup! A full pot in my cute red percolator served 4 of us with a little left over (we drink out of big mugs). So much of our camping gear is modern and high-tech; it's nice to have a red enamel pot that is somehow nostalgic - and utilitarian.

McKinley uses complex, intoxicating language that may make some reviewers call it ""slow"", but I love the way it enriches the tale.Of the two Damarian tales, I think The Hero and the Crown has a little more depth, but I would still read this one first.

"sheer genius, my favourite CD ever: This cd is by far the best piece of music i have ecver listened to. from start to finish there is not a single bad track, and the lyrics are disturbing yet superb, wonderfully embedded in the nialhistic and dark musical framework of The Manic Street Preachers. For a dedicated Manics fan like myself, this is as good as it gets, with songs like Yes, She is Suffering, Archieves of Pain, Die in the Summer time and PCP which just blow you away. Over all an awe-inspiring piece of music which would take a hell of an album to even challenge it. the fact that this album was followed only 18 months later by the more comercial and mundane Everything must go is depressing, but if you want a taste of the real manics, and a brief glimpse into the brilliant mind of Ritchie Edwards buy this album.

"15dB Broadband Cable Amplifier: I was disappointed in this product. When I attached it at the cable source it created probles for my broadband connection and living TV set. I did install it at my TV on the second floor where I was originally having signal deterioration and it worked for awhile. I would first suggest having your cable company in and ""tweak"" your cable throughput - it shouldn't cost you anything other than sitting around waiting for a service call. I no longer have it installed and will resell it on ebay.

"Huge Disappointment!: We made the mistake of purchasing these sliding switches for almost every room of our house. The plastic sliding knobs have broken or cracked on nearly every switch. When paying high dollar prices, I expect quality. Hunter has really disappointed me with this item. I have looked and asked for replacement knobs in every store and online and have had no luck. Seems like Hunter may have put themselves in a position to at least sell replacement knobs, but they have failed me again. I wouldn't buy these again, and I would never recommend them. Look for a sturdier quality switch.

"Great gift: I read the reviews before buying this for a friend's 42nd birthday (42!), and was a little uncertain what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised to find that the pages are of a reasonable weight considering the size. I'm sure a purist would rather have each individual book, but this is a nice collection for the bookshelf.

"""Tomorrow Never Dies"" will leave you breathless.: Pierce Brosnan returns as 007 in the awesome ""Tomorrow Never Dies."" There is some insane action, and it is relentless. A thrilling car chase in an auto garage, Bond and Bond girl Wai Lin's heart-stopping mid-air escape down the side of a scyscraper, and a wild helicopter-motorcycle chase across the rooftops of Saigon are among the finest action sequences ever filmed. The memorable title song is performed admirably by sexy Sheryl Crow, though one wishes the song didn't have to be cut for the titles sequence. Michelle Yeoh is a lethal Bond girl, the first to be truly an equal. Jonathan Pryce(the guy from the car commercials) is an excellent villain as Elliot Carver, and Gotz Otto convincingly portrays his masochistic henchman, Stamper. While he is not in Connery's class(who is?), Brosnan has what it takes to play Bond. Perhaps more than any other actor to take up the role, Pierce Brosnan LOOKS like Bond. Make no mistake, this movie is awesome.

"The book title is too harsh: I can understand the point of trying to bring smiles and laughter to a difficult situation. But the fact of the matter is that everyone one of us WOULD RATHER clean out the garage instead of doing chemo. I wish the title was different and then this book could be given as a as a ""pick-me-up"" gift to someone who is going through cancer treatment. BUT with the title as it is and some of the strong sarcastic comments in the book, it leaves you feeling uneasy about passing this book along to someone going through a life or death situation.

"Save your Money!: If you want to read a book that glorifies tin pot dictators and excuses terrorism this is the book for you. This book has little real economic content and Author has little real understanding of capitalism or modern economics. The Author has an agenda of socialism and anti-Americanism that is easily apparent from the start of the book. If you are looking for an Anti-American rant that blames America and capitalism for all the worlds environmental and economic problems you found the right book. The book consists of rant after rant against capitalism, repeats previously discredited conspiracy theories as fact and appears to be nothing but a cry by the Author for you to feel sorry for him. Don't waste your money or your time on this book.

"Avoid it: I brought this home and had it up and running pretty quickly. I didn't experience problems transferring video from a VCR to my computer.So why one star?Well, I feel the box and their ads are misleading. The DVC 80 can only capture video in AVI format, with dimensions of 360 x 240, about half the size of of a TV screen. There is no mention of this anywhere in the minimal documentation that comes with the item. I thought I was doing something wrong, and tried to get in touch with customer service, but the wait on the phone was too long. I finally got an email to them, and their only response was that if I wanted MPEG-2, or a resolution of 720 x 480, I should have bought the DVC 150. It would have been nice to know that before I put out my money.

"Ballets of the Forties and Fifties described.: For someone interested in the ballets before 1956 and the ballet companies who danced them, this is for you. This is what happened to the ballet world after Diaghilev's death in 1929. Out of this new world were born the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theater) and the New York City Ballet founded by George Balanchine who got his start with Diaghilev's company.

"Never have understood the appeal of this book: The language is dated, the protagonist annoying. I was assigned this in high school decades ago and reread it recently. Its appeal is still lost on me, but I suspect its fans are readers who came of age in the 50s, a naive and long ago time now, and that young readers today, or even those of us who are not Boomer age, find it outdated and pointless, kind of like its author's disappearing act, tho I liked Salinger's other books.

"WAP4400N POS: I purchased two of these AP's. they are a POS. They constantly need rebooting. I upgrade firmware and it doesn't take the change. Tech support tells me to reset the AP to factory defaults after upgrading firmware, which I try and the firmware still does not upgrade. When they work they work ok except the WAP mode did not allow wireless clients to attach, only the bridge worked. I only use them as a point to point bridge now and still it's reboot, reboot, reboot.

"It works!: I've used this product several times now. I use the big ones for my legs, pits, and bikini area and the little one for above my mouth.It is a lot less messier than using a microwave for a tub of wax with a wooden stick.I found that I need it heated for at least 30 minutes on high for the wax to work well. For the more delicate area above my lips, I impatiently started before 30 minutes (15?) and I ended up giving myself a tiny bruise. Very small, didn't hurt...wasn't the most sitely though.The wax does cool quickly. If I am not finished fast enough, I need to let the sticks sit in the warmer some more (5 minutes?) in order for efficiency.I never used the strips that came with it.

"A major dissapointment: I have to admit, I was optimistic about this game, exicited even. I haven't played a good Batman game since....ever! Probably the most fun I've ever had with a Batman game was the driving portion of BatMan returns for the Sega CD, now that's sad. From the moment you press power on your GameCube you can tell things aren't going to be pretty. The CGI opening is decent, but I've seen better on PS1. Once the game starts you'll quickly become aware of the jaggey graphics and horrible camera. The camera is in a ""fixed"" position, much like Resident Evil. But the camera never lines up where it should, making jumping from one area to the next nothing more than a guess. The gameplay is awkward and frustrating making even the first level unusally hard and frustrating. Stay away from this game. If you're itching for a super hero adventure try Spider-Man the Movie, that game is a fine example of what a comic/movie game is all about.

"Poor Effort: Very disapointed.

"BUYERS BEWARE!: I got this DVD and it was as described. But the DVD was scratched as it had got out of the hook in the box. I could hear the DVDs banging inside when I got the package. Upon contacting the seller, they were willing to replace it but expect me to pay the shipping cost. As per their returns policy, where they ask customer to refer to Amazon return policy (seems like they don't have one), it is clearly mentioned that Amazon will pay the return shipment if it is their error. And here the error is on the side of the seller as it was not packaged properly and hence the DVDs in the package got scratched. But they get into unnecessary argument. Never will I deal with such a seller and waste my time. They accept their mistake and expect buyer to pay the penalty! How ironic!

"Needs to watched as 1 &2. And even then...: Without the extended dialogue sections between the various characters, which also act as useful exposition, this is is hardly the classic too much trumpeted. There is nothing one hasn’t seen many times before in other films. This is often something I have always thought of QT films, as if he simply took a bunch of movies, edited out sections, tied them together, and shot it all over again. Jackie Brown is his only original enough movie, which I think is his best, to date.If a Directors cut were to happen, I think Kill Bill 1 & 2 should be made into one complete movie and some superfluous scenes removed. Apart form that, the overall style and chronological order of the construction is very well executed and the acting is of a high standard.

"Very strange book: The first book I've ever read by Phillip K Dick, although I've seen a bunch of movies based on his books (Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly). The story starts off describing the life of a major celebrity and his lifestyle - casual sex partners from Hollywood hills, romps in Venice, drug indulgences and plenty of crazy, surrealistic living - before his life becomes surrealistic itself. He manages to cope with a descent into anonymity and all sorts of quirky escape-the-cops-with-the-weird-stranger-who-just-befriended-you action in it that we've now gotten used to. Yeah, right.At the end, there's an odd, cowardly encounter with the policeman of the title, and then some sort of crazy ""ten years after, this is where the story's proponents ended up"" sort of thing.

"A Disappointing Book: The fact that the body remembers the psychological injuries inflicted on the mind is not new. What I found very disappointing and almost incredible is the fact that the author draws up a list of possible abuses and puts at the same level the trauma of a painful surgery and the emotional or/and sexual abuse of a child mistreated by her parents for years. The book is simplistic and first of all sends the wrong message to people who carries deep emotional wounds. It is close to the superficial self-help books that claim that they can solve your problems once and for all. This must be untrue given the huge number of books of this kind, all of them promising what they do not deliver. And the reader who needs serious help keeps buying the latest ""secret"" book that holds all the answers to your problems.

I read a lot and I realize that I may be considered not ""deep"" enough to understand what she is saying, but almost every sentence seems to consist of a lot ""I am you, you are me, we are invisible, we are nothing, we are everything so we are nothing.""Perhaps it would be better if I were familiar with her earlier works and I will probably read them because so many people LOVE this book. But it almost feels like a sham, like the Emperor has no clothes. So on the whole, I admit that I don't get about half of what she's saying - I think a little more background or examples might help. I dunno. I'm not sure if I had a stroke in the desert that I would be comforted by her simply staring at me ""in love"". (from one of the chapters). I wish I could love it, but I don't - still reading it though.

Not only is the music good, but these guys put on a great live show. I've not been disapointed with any of the tracks on the cd, in fact I'd say the CD as a whole is great.

"For the most part... sour talent & plot: This is one of those movies you will want to watch only once. There was so much potential for the story line and comedy, but it appears somewhere along the line everyone just got lazy. The only worthy converse is between the father and daughter. Huey Lewis, Gwyneth Paltrow and Arnold McCuller's acting and talent were great, but everyone else really lacked. Especially Maria Bello's, which I was really surprised that she was cast to sing since she has no talent and her voice just made you want to turn off the volume. There is a ton of holes in the story line and talent with this one. Save this for a rainy, bored day or skip it all together....

On the show, he sang and excelled in a variety of musical genres. However, on ""Measure of a Man,"" the producers have done Clay a disservice by giving him only mediocre ballads to sing. I kept hoping for at least one uptempo song--or funky song--or even funny song, to display Clay's amazing range and playful personality. I guess I'll have to wait for a concert DVD to get a full-fledged dose of Clay to rival his AI performances, because this CD doesn't deliver.

Even shows like Leave it to Beaver, Dick Van Dyke, My Three Sons, The Munsters etc blew away Dennis the Menace.

"Hilarious, and the Dub Was Very Good: I have to say that this is one of the funniest animes I have ever seen. It's full of wacky slapstick humor, visual parodies, and tons of other goofiness. My favorite parts of Volume 1 are the Action/P.O.W. parody in the 3rd episode, and the dating simulation parody in episode 4. As far as the dub, I found it to be quite good. Jessica Calvello's Excel is just as annoying-sounding as the Japanese voice actress, which to me means she's doing spot-on work. Unfortunately, ADV's accelerated-release schedule for the series did not give her the rest needed between volumes, and she blew out her voice. There will be a new voice actress in the dub for volumes 4, 5, and 6.

""Whenever I hear of someone being 'gluten intolerant' or 'lactose intolerant', for example, I feel I've been missing out. I want to be gluten intolerant too. I mean, how much longer do we have to put up with that gluten crap?"" This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on.

"Incredibly Sexist and Somewhat Racist: I would not suggest allowing children to watch this film unless you are completely comfortable with perpetuating sexist and racist stereotypes. Annoyed by depictions of female being ""saved"" by male counterparts, and glowing depictions of ""life being perfect"" for Natives prior to arrival of whites is a bit of a stretch. This film perpetuates several misconceptions about Native Americans, which are incredibly unnecessary.

"This book canonizes Jackie Kennedy.: After having read Doris Goodwin's book, The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys, I was very disappointed in the lack of objectivity in As We Remember Her.

"3 1/2 Stars - Needs More Realism but Has Some Heart: Janie Jones is one of those smaller films that depends on their story and it delivers pretty solidly until the end. The teenage actress who appeared in Little Miss Sunshine works well in this film, making some borderline saccarine scenes play as authentic. Elisabeth Shue is fine in her smaller role but you get the feeling that a lesser known actress could have done just as well. The story is essentially the development of a relationship between a rocker dad and the daughter he didn't know. What makes it work is that lead actor is good enough as a singer to qualify as a rocker not good enough to be great. The relationship between him and his ""surprise"" teenage daughter is rocky and a work-in-progress that is good to see develop. The ending is pat and neat...which disappoints. If you like films like the recent FAMILIES LIKE US, then this is one that may appeal to you.

I could literally see grey areas in the dough where it had been stained by the nonstick coating and metal. Had to throw it away.

The power, the intensity, the range, the texture, that hardhitting gospel sound. It's so downright incredibly amazing.. it's almost supernatural. Mr. Soul himself, Sam Cooke (whom Linda was OBVIOUSLY influenced by) would have been a huge fan of hers, I'm sure of it.Boy, and I thought I could really sing, lol. Sister Linda Jones has definitely put ME in MY place, lol. What she does with ""Your Precious Love"" is ............. I'm speechless.

Also ""Teddy Boy"" another song from ""McCartney"" is realy funny.""What's the new Mary Jane"" is an unrelesed song that is also good. ""Not Guilty"" is a song that George wrote.

"Billy at his peak: Songs in the Attic is a wonderful glimpse at a performer at his peak. Coming off of the huge commercial success of Glass Houses and 52nd Street, Billy changes gears completely. Instead of releasing a live album that recycles his more recent hits, he dusts off some of his earlier work and presents it to us in a live setting.You can see in these performances the brilliance and passion of an artist who is completely committed to his material. Whether it be the intimacy of ""You're My Home"" performed in a small club or the intensity of ""Captain Jack"" in a large arena, each performance seems perfectly set in the appropriate venue.Billy Joel is at his absolute best here. I particularly recommend ""Songs"" to the fan who has only seen Billy in his more mundane concerts of the last few years, often paired with Elton John. This album shows you a performer at his creative peak.

Speaking as someone who has had anorexia for the last 15 years, I'd have to say that this book doesn't so much teach one to conquer their food addiction as it does teach one to become obsessed with avoiding food. I can't believe some of the things it suggests you do... A bit over the top in my opinion.

"Works with Logitech devices: After trying the Belkin PS/2 and USB 2-port KVMs, I finally tried this one based on the other customer reviews. It does indeed work with my Logitech Elite keyboard and MX700 mouse connected to Windows XP and Fedora Core 3 systems. All extra buttons on the keyboard and mice work as they should under XP using the Logitech drivers. (I have not assigned the extra keys under FC3.) I can't make a judgement on the audio quality, since I do not use it on this switch.This switch even works when one of the systems crashes, something the Belkin switch couldn't do. With the Belkin, whenever one system went down, I had to unplug the switch from the computer just to switch to the other computer.

"Negative and exaggerated: I base my opinion on Mantel's novel from 18 years of living in Saudi Arabia. In defence of this book it is obvious she writes from first hand experience of Jeddah and she suceeds in creating an uneasy atmosphere from the start. However, the characters are, without exception, somewhat bland, empty people, lacking strength or depth. This may well be Mantel's intention together with the lack of substantial conclusion to the plot. Mantel dwells entirely on the negatives in Saudi and very little on the positives, such as the genuine friendships one acquires by getting to know people from a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures.The success of this novel must surely lie in its negative sensationalism rather than its literary credibility. It would be tragic if readers were put off visiting Saudi Arabia on the strength of this book which portrays bigotry and ignorance.

If you ever see or hear Joe interviewed you may not pick him as the guy behind this kind of Rock, but in his day he was just about the best rocker out there and kind of crazy out of control. He now reflects back on that lifestyle as a part of his life that defines his demeanor of today. Way slowed down, mentally as well. Thanks for giving yourself up for us Joe, I have really enjoyed you there in my life with me. Enjoy!

"Adds Little To The Knowledge of Fabric Creation and Usage: I have been in the textile industry going on 30 years now, and I bought this book in hopes of, perhaps, learning about the creation of certain fabrics and their application within several industries. After reading through a mini-biography of the owner of the fabrics (who evidently was ""somebody"" in the industry but who I never heard of), I saw photos of different types of fabric with no analysis or application information attached. I have to agree with the earlier reviewer who states that it appears that this is nothing more than a collection of fabrics that perhaps were gathered up and photographed to create a publishable book. It's certainly not large enough to be considered a pretty ""table"" book, and it doesn't contain much in the way of technical information. Given the opportunity to go back in time, I would pass on this one in favor of the more popular and well-known publishers on textiles.

If you have seen them, all this is, is a good collector's addition.If you have somehow made it this far without ever having seen The Matrix, be warned: The Matrix is extreme, extremly imaginative, and a good cast.

"Brilliant and Sparse: This book is beautiful. The different narratives help enhance the telling of the story. Each character is so unique and true to form. The writing is sparse yet vast. I really felt transported to the cold winter woods of the Adirondacks, like in a Dreiser novel. I didn't want the book to end, but I felt compelled to read until the very end. The novel poses many questions about relationships and perceptions. Read it if you want to find the answers.

"Very Pleased!: I bought two of these reflector holders and have been very pleased with my purchase. I wasn't sure about the rubber grips that hold the reflecotrs in place but once I attached my 40""x60"" reflector to it and foudnt that it could hold the extra large reflector without slipping I was sold. It does not come with instructions on how to attach it to a light light stand so I had to play around with it until I figured it out, but once I got it on it held securly. Overall very pleased and would purchase more in the future if the need arose.I did upload several pictures of the reflector holder to give you a better idea of how it works I'll see if I can up load a video on how to attach it to a light stand since I found that to be the only real frustrating thing about the reflector holder. But if you've owned reflector holders and you know how to work the Mini Grip Head then you should do just fine.

"Do not waste your time buying this book: When I bought this book, it had a basic edge to it. I was new to the craft, and that book looked like it could help me on my 'magickal quest' It didn't, It is not a book for beginners and it's not usefull to those with experience. Buckland leads you to belive that 'this is the way it is' but thats NOT the way it is. Wicca is open, a way of life but at the same time something that you create to fit your life style, He though, does not give you that impression. If your a beginner, go out and buy a book from Silver RavenWolf, like To ride a magick broom stick. Not only does that book get 5 stars, it DOES give the basics a beginner should know.

"A great description of the ""Marine Experience"" in Vietnam.: This book includes the most accurate description of Marine Corps boot camp that I've ever seen (for better or worse!) While the names of the individuals are fictional, this Reviewer recognizes the character of the Drill Instructor in the book as a real person who the Reviewer met while in the Marine Corps. The reader will find himself deeply involved in the lives of the the two main characters in the book - one, an officer, the other an enlisted man. The combat descriptions have the ring of truth, and are gripping and well written. This book is a real page-turner, and a must for Vietnam veterans, or people who want to understand the Vietnam experience told from the Marine perspective.

Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences.

I was using lump charcoal exclusively in the side fire box. I don't know if that was the problem or not.

His fiancee found them in the bed together, Slone made Whitney become his fiancee, because his Mother had been so happy to hear he was engaged he had to use Whitney to be his fiancee.Slone's mom never met Gleda and Whitney was happy to help out, problem, Slone had broken his engagement to Glenda long before the party and long before catching Whitney and Slone together.This is a good book but I also like Susan Fox, the late great Betty Neels, the late Essie Summers, Rebecca Winters, Helen Brooks, and Eva Rutland.

"""Bristle"" does not mean ""natural bristle"": I wish I had read the reviews before I bought these. These are polyester brushes of the poorest quality. I know others said that their bristle didn't shed, but mine came out by the handfuls. I will donate them to the little kids to use.

"Bad DVDs: This comes in two discs. Disc #2 has a ""Side A and Side B."" When you play disk #2 side B, it shows the same episodes as Disc #1. So it's a duplication of episodes.To return this is a hassle and you can't exchange the item, you have to opt for a refund, which is not what I wanted.Just a messed up DVD with a lousy return process and an unsatisfactory resolution, even if you decide to go through the process.

It was so easy to remove the old one and install the new ribbon, anyone can figure it out. The ribbon is exactly like the old one and prInts nice and dark without smearing. Fast delivery, too!

"Mixing Christianity with Evolution: I was disappointed that this book tries to blend evolutionary theory with a Christian perspective. Evolution contradicts the Bible and a Christian world-view and it's dangerous to try to mix the two. I am surprised that a publisher like Tommy Nelson would put this into the hands of children. Lesson to be learned: just because a book is ""Christian"" doesn't mean parents should assume it is what they want for their kids! I highly recommend the Jonathan Park audio series for adventure and creationist perspective.

I didnt like it...: A mi no me gusta mucho Yahir pues primero copio lo single ""Alucinado"" de un cantor italiano, Tiziano Ferro (que canta lo tema mucho mejor que Yahir) y tambien me entere que 2 otras canciones de lo cd son copiadas de cantores que todavia no hacen mucho exito pero que estan empienzando. Antes Yahir me encantava pero despues de lo que passo con las ""copias"" de las canciones ... me gusta mucho mas Tiziano Ferro!!!I dont like Yahir because first of all he copied the single ""Alucinado"" from an italian singer, Tiziano Ferro (who sings much better than Yahir) and than now I found out that theis 2 other songs in his cd that are also copied from singers that still doesnt have many sucess but are starting. I used to like Yahir but now with everything thats happening with the ""copies"" of other singers songs .... I started liking Tiziano Ferro!!!

That book assumes that you want to learn the whys and not just the by-the-numbers hows of multimedia development. Demystified also covers Lingo in much more depth.

Unless you already happen to have extensive life experience with Africa, are you really in any position to run up your nose at an outstanding novel that also informs us about US involvement in Zaire?

"Like Watching a Comic Book!: I didn't particularly enjoy the first movie, so I was a bit skeptical for this one. The first one had some pretty bad acting and it dragged along getting the whole back story out of the way.Now that the back story was out of the way, Sam Raimi could just take the franchise where it was supposed to go. This movie was like watching a comic book unfold, especially the fight scene with Doc Ock and Spidey when MJ is kidnapped. The acting improved and the characters seemed natural, and the cast fit their roles perfectly. Bruce Campbell had an excellent scene in this movie, and I can't wait to see what he's going to be in the next one.

They cover a vast range of situations, personalities and styles. It is true, some are more worthy than others, but Russell's ability to create a new person, a distinct individual, who stays with you in each character he portrays, keeps me hooked on anything he does. I can't wait to add this to my collection and I am greedy...I want more! I am glad Russell is so young and never quite satisfied with his work because that means he will keep producing for years to come. Go Russell! I like his music too! Can you tell I'm a fan?

"Not worth it.: If you love your typical vampire movie then I suppose you'll love this one. But there's nothing new here. The vampires are freaky and there's a lot of blood, but it's the sequence of events that gets in the way.Instead of focusing on how to avoid crazed vampires for 30 days, the movie skips over significant periods of time with no explanation of what happened in between. Not to mention that the vampires had literally 30 days to find the hidden humans in a town where there couldn't have been more than 20 or 30 places to hide. The movie makes the vampires look freaky, but incredibly stupid.Also, Ben Foster plays the exact same character in this movie as '3:10 to Yuma', Josh Hartnett seems bored, and the relationship his character has with Melissa George isn't believable at all.But again, if you want typical vampire gore, enjoy.

"Disappointing: While I don't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over, this departure by Adriana Trigiani is not successful.While it has the obligatory trip to Italy, it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip, I would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here. Instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di Crespi's New Jersey clients.The book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no New Jersey Italian stereotype is left unturned.Not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well.If you insist on reading it, save your money and go to the library.

"Disappointing After All: WOW, I am really shocked! Hmmmm, I am downright mad that I not only bought this but am trying to find a reason to like it just because IT IS DAFT PUNK. Another reviewer said they are ""going back to their roots?"" What are you talking about!? There are no roots on this album! It's more of a new experimental electro album ,with Daft Punk feel, full of never ending loops and robot voices! I kept waiting for a song to change or kick into high gear, but no! Honestly, I would rather listen to just a kick drum and hi-hats all day than this!I shall calm for a second and tell you I did enjoy Track 9-""Technologic"" It seems to be the only track they put any thought into...and it's on the lyrical end of the spectrum.Seriously folks, if you want experimental Daft Punk, buy Thomas Bangalter's soundtrack for IRREVERSIBLE.

"OK, but not recommended.: This book is the sequel to Welcome To Temptation, which was about Sophie and Phin. Davy had a smaller role in that book and now this book is about him. The plot didn't make sense to me. Someone paints pictures and signs them with a fake name in the way someone uses a ""pen name"" to write books. The painter in this story felt she might go to jail if anyone found out. That didn't make sense to me since the name she signed wasn't a name used by anyone else. Davy is a reformed con man who meets the painter and more events happen. I didn't enjoy the plot or the characters that much. Nothing surprised or delighted me. Only once did I chuckle at something humorous. I read this because I loved three other books by this author which are ""Bet Me,' ""Welcome To Temptation"" and ""Anyone But You."" I do not recommend ""Faking It."" Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: current day U.S. Copyright: 2002. Genre: contemporary romance.

"2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams: 2001 Maniacs was one of the best horror remakes of all time. Robert Englund as the mayor was priceless and the supporting cast was good. A good mix of cool gore and humor really made it a treat. Then I waited two years or more for them to make a sequel. Boy, I could have waited anther two!The movie sucks beyond belief, a big let down. The humor is alright but the people they go out and slaughter are really annoying. Bill Mosley is a respected actor among horror movie fans and he did good but the script was poorly written. Granny is back and she did a good job as well but like Mosley, something was off. I didnt care for the rest of the maniacs. In the first movie, they are against blacks and asians but they are in this movie. The gore was cool but there wasn't often in my opinion. Then ending was pretty stupid as well.Overall, if you enjoyed the first one then you may enjoy this movie. I didnt laugh too much.

"Utterly Lacking: Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with ""On Beauty."" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of ""street"" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's ""Straight Man.""

Having writers imitate other famous writers instead of Doyle to do a Holmes story is one of the dumbest gimmicks ever. There are far too many ""hard-boiled"" style stories with dialogue totally unsuited to Holmes and Watson, while the one ascribed to Wells had Holmes spouting Wells' socialist propaganda, which is something even Wells left to secondary characters. The story ascribed to Kerouac is totally unreadable. The rest fall of the stories fall somewhere between these extremes.

This model has the same shape as the Riviera and as I stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic, the Riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so I would be skeptical in buying this one.The only reason I gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you can't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly.

"Waste of money: This toy was purchased for our 9-month old daughter, and not only did she hate it, but we hated it, too. First of all, the music is deafening. It scared all of us the first time we turned it on! Also, the motor that makes the balls pop out of the top is really loud. Oftentimes, the balls fly across the room, and you have to chase after them. (They really like to hide underneath couches and beds...) The first time we set our daughter down to see it, she screamed in terror. It's ridiculous to buy this toy for anyone under the age of 18-months, and I think it's very misleading that the box recommends the toy for 9-months and up. Unfortunately, the family member who bought the toy did not keep their receipt, and the day after we received it, we gave it to Goodwill. Good riddance!

"dismal, stereotypical view of women: I read the first 50 pages and was bored out of my mind as well as appalled at the content. Obviously this woman and the women who like this stuff have no self-esteem to think of their lives as more than hours of waxing and makeup and PURSES. My god, get over it and start living a life. I'll continue my life by not finishing this book - I have better things to do with my time that to waste it on women who waste their lives.

"A New Direction for Haste the Day...Too Bad: Sorry, but I have to agree with many other critics of HTD's ""new direction."" This isn't a bad album, and probably has the best production value when compared to their other releases, but Jimmy Ryan (to me, at least) was Haste the Day. I have NEVER in my entire life heard anything like his vocals onBurning BridgesandWhen Everything Falls- yeah, I've heard lots of vocalists, lots of ""screamers,"" but Ryan has a unique quality to his voice that I've never heard replicated nor perfectly described. Check out the first two minutes of ""Substance"" fromBurning Bridgesand I think you'll know what I mean. I'll continue to support these guys, but I don't think it would be a bad idea to change their name...to a lot of people, this just isn't Haste the Day any more.

"Great Sailor Moon Flick: Sailor Moon S is a great flick with some minor glitches, but all together, it's a buy you won't regret. The movie begins with the senshi on their winter vacation. Luna comes down with a fever and is being cured by an astronomer. His name is Kakeru. Luna starts to fall in love with him after a while. The situation turns bad for Luna as Kakeru's sort of girlfriend, Himoko, appears. Also, the senshi are facing a dillema when an evil ice queen Kaguya threatens to freeze the Earth and turn make it part of her collection. I cried the first time I saw this movie just because I'm emotional. Don't blame me! I think you'll feel more for the characters if you switch to Japanese with subtitles. The dub is just too, loud. The voices are, shrieky. The extras are something to be happy about. There's a picture gallery, a biography on each senshi, a story on Princess Snow Kaguya, and a preview of some Pioneer animation titles.

"Not for Mac users: I bought this keyboard, because the features looked very nice. Then I tried to connect it to my Mac via USB to take advantage of GarageBand.

Casio need to develop OS X drivers and having contacted Casio it looks like this will never happen.

"Childhood Memories: I had this book as kid, and loved it. The plot is pretty odd: The Empire State Building decides to take a look around NYC, and on a very foggy day, picks up and starts checking out Manhattan. While the building and a little boy are floating around the Hudson etc, the caretakers of the building have their hands full trying to keep people from noticing that the building is missing from the 6th story up.

"Not one thing or the other.: August 13, 2002I rented this one on a lark. I liked ""Re-Animator"" quite abit, and I hoped it might be similar. I found it lackingon one hand as a gory, Grade 'B' horror flick and on theother as a Lovecraft interpretation. The moral, I guess:beware credits that list unknown European actresses andforeign television production companies.

"These are getting addictive: I am religiously reading these in order, and each one is progressively harder to put down. Obviously one has to suspend a lot of disbelief - Anita beats a lot of baddies who are bigger than her - but Ms Hamilton writes will enough to persuade you to do this. These are great stories of the supernatural and magic, which move at a fast pace - none of your languid Anne Rice-style eroticism here. But then, this is what makes them entertaining. The other thing that lifts this series above the ordinary is the characters, which are well-drawn, and appealing. It's nice to read stories populated by people with feelings. I am looking forward to seeing how Anita's new relationship is handled.

"STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!: Reba didn't do herself any favors using three producers to get this mixture of pop goulash out of the studio. Everything is so mixed up here its hard to tell where its going!! I didn't know if I was listening to country, rhythm and blues, celtic, rock, jazz or new age. Reba is obviously struggling to find an identity here trying to cross all musical bridges but not quite making it!! To state that her album out put is prolific is accurate, but calling all of them brilliant is a decided overstatement. This CD will attest to that!

"Awful remake of a great film: I don't mind remakes, but this is probably the worst one I have ever seen. Turning everything good into a complete mess, destroying every ounce of suspense, not even managing to entertain as a decent Christmas movie!Billy is given a backstory that is disgusting, pointless and hardly entertaining. All the details are presented in such a way that it becomes a dull mess of revolting characters, and the way the story progresses is not mysterious, scary, entertaining, cool or funny.There is nothing to be found in this film. It's as nauseating and sickening as spraying fake snow down your throat for one and a half hour.

"Best car seats, extra base a must!: If you purchase the Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio infant car seat, it comes with one base. I highly recommend purchasing a second if you will be putting your baby in more than one car! We have a total of three or four bases (I've lost count) between my car, my husband's, my mom's, and maybe my dad's. It's very handy to be able to switch the seat from car to car without having the fight with the base every time. While the cost may be a little steep, the base works with all versions of the Primo Viaggio, so when we replaced our car seat for our third baby (five years later) we were able to keep all of our bases for the new car seat. Because of the quality of the car seats and the length of time we've been able to use them, I feel the price (and my children's safety) have been well worth it.

"Beware skin reaction!!!!!!!!: Read the fine print on the box where it tells you to test for reaction on a small area of the skin. I wish we would have done that. My 2 year old daughter broke out terribly within 2 minutes in the tub with these crayons. The allergic reaction resulted in huge red areas on her skin that came in contact with the water. Those red areas had large, swollen, whitish areas in the middle that looked like blisters. We panicked and called the doctor but ultimately they went down after we washed with soap and water (clean water) and gave her children's benedryll. Our son was also in the tub and had no reaction, but we obviously give this product the lowest possible rating.

"Boo Hoo: I just want to agree with most of the reviewers: this book was certainly not what I expected (...). The fact that the two main characters, Richard and Kahlan, are barely in the book, is indeed disappointing. With the conclusion of Faith of the Fallen, I assumed(obviously incorrectly) that Pillars would be the story of Richard's retaking command of the D'Haran army, as the people of Altar'Raug proved themselves to him. Instead, Pillars was about a young woman we had never heard of and a sadistic, animal killing, ""oaf"" named Oba. Also, I was very curious to see what Nicci's role would have been in the fight, now that she had found the answer to the question she was looking for in Faith. Overall, the book was disappointing and I can only hope that the 8th book(the next one) gets back to the fundamentals.

"Uniquely wild: If your one of the few, like myself, who enjoys both classical and metal, this CD offers some nice ear candy. When I first read that Dave Lombardo was venturing into classical I thought I needed glasses, but as I read on it sounded like a really cool idea and became less hard to believe. As it turns out, Vivaldi blends quite well with modern percussion. This is a very cool CD. I don't think it will appeal to very many people, so it will probably remain in obscurity, but it may very well become a novelty in the cult classic realm. The only complaint I have about this album is I feel there should have been fewer vocal arrangements and more instrumental pieces. If your in the mood for something different, try this on for size. Just keep in mind that for most, it will be an acquired taste.

"M-Audio Izotope Ozone 3 Mastering Suite: Finally, someone developed a suite of plug-ins for ""mastering"" that really work. The audio performance is fantastic and they are really simple to use. Great presets, great customer service, great everything. I can not give any assessment attribute anything less than a 5.I have been producing audio for a good number of years and putting the polish on a mixdown has always been, well, lets just say less than easy, until I discovered this software. Hours of work, and hit-and-miss frequency tweeking, etc. are accomplished with a simple selection and a little fine tuning.Even making custom presets, that incorporate established equalization curves, is a snap.The most difficult thing is saying the complete name of this software in one breath.I'd recommend trialing it and if you are like me, you'll be hooked.Ted GitzkeFreeTimeWe Write Right Music

"Sadly not worth the wait: I read Big Bad Wolf in a marathon session and couldn't wait for the sequel. Unfortunately, London Bridges didn't live up to my expectations. I expected that the story would be equally riveting and instead found a convoluted mess of characters that had nothing to do with one another at the core. The story line was disjointed and full of truly ridiculous plot twists that ultimately had little or no bearing on the outcome. Perhaps I missed the point? I don't know - I'm a big Patterson fan but found London Bridges to be lacking the mystery and intrigue I've grown so fond of. By the end, I really didn't care who was the Wolf. Not up to the usual Patterson quality.

"precursor of de Sade: I decided to read this after noting Henry Miller's enthusiasm for the book in The Tropic of Cancer (I figured if Miller liked it, it must be good). I was sorely disappointed. I have nothing against bawdy or scatological humor on principle, but I found Rabelais simply boring, tasteless, and completely bereft of genuine humor. This is the sort of thing that gets guffaws from 12-year old boys who think that simply using foul language makes them endlessly witty. If you want early novelists with a tendency toward the bawdy and/or scatological, I recommend Boccaccio, Cervantes and Sterne. And if you absolutely, positively must wallow in a cesspool of disgusting smut, go to the master - the Marquis de Sade.

I practically fell out of my seat the first time I heard Tennant's dramatic and superb change to the cadenza during the Adagio! Fans of the Aranjuez should be similarly surprised and pleased. Odair Assad's mature, expressive playing complements Malcolm Arnold's Serenade beautifully.

"ZERO STARS wasn't one of the rating choices.: Maybe it's because I waited so long for this book that it is such a bitter disappointment. I think Ronald Reagan was the best president this county has hadthis century and I anxiously awaited this biography from his ""authorized"" biographer. But this book is a bad joke. The injecting of fictional episodes into the biography of a real person is unforgivable for a serious biographer. Morris doesn't even do us the curtesy of italicizing what's fictional, so we can skip over it and get to the real stuff. It's hard to say whether the fictional episodes are worse than the constant yammering Morris does about himself. Open the book to any random page and, instead of the life of Ronald Reagan, you get the author talking about himself. To be fair, Ronald Reagan is mentioned every so often. I wanted a biography of Ronald Reagan, not a book about how Morris feels about being the biographer of Ronald Reagan. Just tell us about the life of Ronald Reagan.

My fifteen year old VHS tape of the movie is much clearer and sharper than this DVD. In addition, I noticed a couple of scenes are missing. One is a bit of the opening that was taken from ""Memphis Belle"" (no great loss.) The other is the flashback scene in which the blind commando recalls the rescue mission during which he lost his sight.The movie, loosely based on two different WWII incidents, is terrific. If you haven't seen it, it's worth ordering this DVD at only eight bucks. But if you're hoping to replace your worn out VHS copy with a nice new DVD, save your money.

I think ""Get Happy!"", ""King of America,"" and some others are among the best rock/pop lps ever recorded. But I just can't take this Burt Bacharach business. These songs are so pitiful and insipid they make me sick. I try to give it the benefit of the doubt cause it is EC, but I just can't get with this thing. Come on Elvis, remember you're the angry boy, not some mushy trod-on wimp begging his lover to come back and whip him one more time!

"Machos, maricones and Gays: Cuba and Homosexuality: I was aghast at reading this book! I wonder where or among who Mr. Lumsden has done the research for this book! Has he not heard about the UMAP (Military Units for Support to Production), where so many homosexuals perished dugged to their ears in mudd? Hasn't he even seen the film ""Before night falls"", on the writer Reynaldo Arenas plight whithin Cuba because of his homosexuality? He can rent it at Blockbuster! It's played by Antonio Banderas. And before UMAP there was the big campaign against homosexualkity of mid 1964, where everyone who talked or acted differently ended among prostitutes, pimps, a.s.oReally, I can't understand what has he based his book on. It's the biggest lie I've read in many years.

"this book cuts to the chase: This book is quick and easy to read with a very relaxed and immediate style. Kent seems to have included her interviews with a wide range of American dancers almost word for word, so they read with an immediacy and directness that is refreshing. It is all in there - what works with weight loss, what doesn't and how hard it can be. A wonderful change from all the diet books that promise fabulous pain free results in 10 days! Some of the receipes are more useful than others, and yes, some dancers do seem to eat just lettuce and then dance for 5 hours! Ne're the less, one of the most inspiring but practical books on health and diet and exercise I have read. I really recommend it.

You are shown once how to do a ""piece"" and then you are expected to pause the video and do this piece by yourself 20 or so times.

"their best work: i have every Verve Pipe album, and this is, in my opinion, their best work. A lot of people are oblivious to The Verve Pipe, but lucky for me, i grew up in the Grand Rapids, MI area where they started out. I think this is a highly underated band. There is not a single bad song on this cd, and there is great guitar work on every song. Bullies on Vacation is my personal favorite off of the cd, but it's not a single song that makes this cd good, it is all of them together. I'd recommend this cd to anyone, it's a must have!

There are also plenty of illustrations and charts to reinforce the information. Also, this isn't just one more book taking up space on my bookshelf -- I still use it as a reference to clarify questions that come up. Epidemiology is a clearly written, methodologically presented introduction to the most important concepts in the field.

"Warren Shibles: A Modern Narcissus: The work of Warren Shibles should be avoided for a plethora of reasons. For starters, the topics covered are trivial and mundane which lack the breadth of a true philosophical work. The issues addressed are easily discovered through common sense and fundamental education. Secondly, the style is dry, the voice is weak, and the arrangment is lacking which makes the reading dull and at times utterly boring. Finally, Shibles has a tendency to overglorify himself at the expense of others. Unless you really love Narcissus, avoid his work at all costs!

"The item description is conflicting: In Amazon's product specifications, it says the ingredients are mineral oil, linseed oil and tung oil. Further below, the actual product description says the ingredients are mineral oil, linseed oil and orange oil. So which is it? But actually, it's only the mineral oil that is needed to treat the wood and you can buy mineral oil anywhere for dirt cheap. Linseed oil may contain petroleum products, a definite no-no for food surfaces and can go rancid. Walnut oil or a walnut oil/beeswax mix is best for treating butcher blocks. And to those in the previous reviews that are using this oil on stainless steel and other surfaces, are you kidding? Any surface looks better when you rub any type of oil on it but it only attacts dust and dirt. I guess it would be appropriate to rub oil on such surfaces if your home is on display, but for everyday living, it would be totally inappropriate.

I have purchased a few other seemless backgrounds from Adorama directly, but ordering through Amazon came out with cheaper shipping and handling. I now realize why. This product and the other 2 backgrounds in the same order came damaged with an end on each of them bent over. I do not know where the fault lies for this. Unfortunately, I needed all 3 backgrounds immediately so I was not able to return them but had to unbend and unkink the tube the best I could in order to mount them onto my background holder. All 3 work and are usable since the damage is along the edge and I can keep that out of the frame when I'm shooting. However, this makes me reluctant to order through Amazon again for the same items.

"Don't believe everything you read--this is a decent flick!: After having read some of the reviews here, I did not expect much. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie! If you like history/action/time travel movies, this one presents a very watchable story. Yes, there are some plot holes here and there, but that's not unusual. I found nothing wrong with the acting and casting of characters. Of course the book was better, as most books are, but some liberties had to be taken when paring it down for a 2 hour movie. There are things you'll pick up when you watch a second time, especially if you did not read the book first.A nice bonus is the special features--four of them about the making of the movie that are fairly comprehensive and decently interesting. All in all a worthy dvd, except for the lack of a booklet/chapter list, which is a pet peeve of mine.

"A Good Read: Right off the bat, to let you know, I am new to the Friday the 13th/Jason genre. I recently watched Jason X on DVD and liked it. This is the first book in the Friday the 13th series I read. I liked it so much, I got all the rest but one (and that includes the new Jason X series).As for The Jason Strain, I thought it was fairly well written and very exciting. It had all the elements of a nice read, action/adventure, romance (albeit quick), drama, and of course with Jason-- a lot of blood.Will this go down in history along side the great classics? Probably not, but if you want an easy read with Jason, his machete and zombies run amuck, indulge yourself with this book.

The characters have no depth to their personalities, they are not flawed or personable which makes the book quite hard to get through. There was nothing about the book that made me want more, which saddens me because I was quite looking forward to reading it. I would honestly compare the writing style to that of the Twilight series, (which yes, I admit I did read). This book would be better geared to younger readers.

After working with it for several days I find it one of the best introductory books I have come across for any topic. Flash is a quirky and complicated program, and there are times I would have liked more explanations. But I am so happy that the useful information in this book is not buried in pages of useless examples. This is not a book of samples, ready for you to copy. Nor does it cover advanced scripting topics very well - these could easily double the size of the book. This book is a concise handbook, and an excellent introduction for those that do not require a great deal of hand holding.

I especially appreciated the inclusion of Gonna Raise Hell on this cd. It has always been a favorite of mine and shows what a powerful band Cheap Thick can be. Listening to this cd is as close as you can come to being there live. Keep Rocking Cheap Trick!

"The Pitching Edge by Tom House: House did not write this book for Little League coaches who want to help their kids. It is loaded with hyper-technical jargon that House does not explain and won't make sense to experienced players and coaches. For example, in a section on how to pitch off a mound, House states, ""A pitcher must find and keep an upper body spine-to-hip relationship with a constant angle of flex in posting knee at front leg lift, stride and landing -- directing upper body into torso rotation and launch of a baseball."" What? His science may be correct, but you won't benefit from this book because House does not translate the science into common sense terms that ballplayers will understand.

"I would have give it zero stars, but that wasn't an option: You must be kidding me? The greatest ever? Not even close! This study bible champions such classic heresies as Sabelian Modalism, the Serpent Seed Hypotheses, Baptismal Regeneration, Positive Confession, the strange and unscriptural notion that there once was a preadamic demonic race under the leadership of Lucifer, Adamic Hyper-Dominion, that faith is force that can magically alter physical reality, and many false teachings of the Word of Faith movement. This study bible may have more cross references than the Thompson Study Bible, but that is only because so many of them are spurious. This study bible was obviously written by a collection of fully heterodox apostates. Do yourself a favor, buy just about any other study bible on the market. Almost anything is better. If you are Charasmatic, read The Full Life Study Bible. If you don't believe me then just call Hank Hanegraaff (the Bible Answer Man) and ask him.

"Pretty Good: PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is my favorite book. I was so happy to learn about the many sequels. This was the first book I read. At first I was somewhat skeptical because it almost seems silly to try to continue the greatest story ever told by the greatest authoress ever, but as I read I found it charming and very well told. The wording and style were not as educated as one hoped but it seemed to resemble Ms. Austen's style. It is not the best sequel but it is pretty good.

I don't find that this book has helped me figure out how to retool to stay employed. I'm not using the book and I can't afford to buy things that I don't absolutely need. Not recommended if you are not of the wealthy class and need to keep the wolf from the door. Annoying to hear how the upper class has time and energy to dabble.

"Amazon sent us cheep version of the On Stage bench 2 times!: Just as another person commented, Amazon is shipping a much inferior product than it listed and picture. We got the wrong one, sent it back and they sent us another package containing the same low-end stool with little padding (I think the maker is guardian).We already own an On Stage keyboard bench (which we obviously like) and the two benches side by side are a joke.

Here is someone who lived in horrendous poverty and yet found his life's path in music, theater and dance.

This album shows his diversity in the knowledge of the music from different regions and cultures of Chile. It is a joy to listen to him. His music lives on. I recommend it highly.

"Poorly Constructed, Not Recommended: I bought this timer based on the recommendation of America's Test Kitchen testing lab. The timer works as advertised but the audible alarm is not very robust, you cannot hear it from another room. Control of all of the various functions is somewhat confusing, certainly non-intuitive.Worse, the magnetic strip on the back of the timer is affixed to the plastic body with double-sided tape that will fail in very short order, allowing the magnet to separate from the body. My first timer fell off the front of my fridge onto a hard tile floor, shattering the case and destroying the timer. Amazon replaced that at no charge. A second timer did exactly the same thing after about a week's use, although this time I expected it and it only fell to the countertop.Instead of the dual timer, I do recommend the Polder 898 Clock, Timer and Stopwatch, available in Black or White, $15.00. It is very loud, comes with a laynard so you can hang it around your neck, and is simple to use.

"A Waste Of Time: Though Danielle Steel is not known for her great literature, but for her gripping storytelling, this book could undergo a few changes. I recomend it to people that enjoy a never-ending story, repeat after repeat of the same scenario, and a wimpy, unrealistic, bordering on sleazy main character to relate to. This book is exhausting. Time after time Crystal and Spencer meet again after being apart for a few years, and every time they make up some dumb excuse not to stay with each other. We all know that these books ALWAYS have happy, romantic endings, so why not just get to the point and be done with it? The ending of ""Star"" is one of those that makes you say ""Thats it? All this reading for THAT?"" Seriously, though, do yourself a favor and skip this book. I recomend ""Accident"".

"Child of the Northern Spring: Child of the Northern Spring, the first in a trilogy, covers Guinevere's early years, narrated by the Princess herself. I am impressed at how Ms. Persia Wooley made Gwen a believable narrator that readers can connect with, for I found this Gwen a sincere young woman who is, at first, reluctant to leave her life for the ways of the court. Gwen is the modest little tomboy who eventually grows up and weds who will be the greatest king of all Britain. The reader can laugh, cry, and smile with Gwen (who, in this book, is not an arrogant prick like most people picture Guinevere) all throughout the book as she meets characters like an Irish lad Kevin, the powerful Lady Morgan, and the stately Queen Igraine. I am impressed by Wooley's first book in the trilogy, and I am looking forward to reading the others!

"12th SS Vol I & II: This is an excellent historical reference book. It provides another viewpoint to the Allied histories of the war. There seems to be an obvious bias which is also present in many if not most of the Allied histories. Viewed in the context of contrary histories of the same battles, many points can be clarified.The 12th SS was a fabulous division of fighting men. I see many training and doctrinal attributes that were used in the Marine Corps when I joined. When viewed in a strictly historical perspective of fighting quality and ability there are few formations that can compare with with the 12th SS. I highly recommend these volumes to historians as well as gamers modeling the battles this division was engaged in.

This phone looked like a great deal in the store, but now I know why they were selling them so cheap!The range is pathetic. Sound quality goes down very quickly as you get away from the base. It reminds me of the very first cordless phones that you had to hold in just the right orientation in just the right place to get good reception.The LCD display is all but illegible.

Props to both artists for writing their own material (for the most part).This is a STELLLAARR return to the scene for Robyn, who surprisingly took a turn on background vocals for the once-reigning princess, Britney Spears, on ""Piece Of Me"" - it was produced by some of Robyn's Swedish buddies.BUY THIS ALBUM if you are a fan of envelope pushing, yet widely accessible pop music that will live on as a testament to what can be done without consulting Timbaland, The Neptunes, Rodney Jerkins, Max Martin, The Matrix, or John Shanks.

"My favorite Christmas movie has an okay Blu-Ray: Regardless of how it gets played on endless repeat on Christmas day, I still can't comprehend when people tell me they hate this movie. HOW CAN ANYONE DISLIKE THIS FILM? In my opinion, A Christmas Story perfectly captures the perspective of Christmas from the average child with hilarious results. And the ""true stories"" from the screenwriter's childhood have become classic gags. The leg lamp, the evil mall Santa, getting caught saying the F word by parents, the Bumpus' dogs, and sticking your toungue to a frozen pole are such classic material that I still laugh each time I see them to this day.On the video quality front, the BluRay is just okay. It's certainly the best this film has ever looked on home video, but you won't find anything crazy-go-nuts in terms of visual quality. Luckily, the disc is cheap enough to be worth the money if you dont already have it on DVD.

"(Almost) The Greatest Book I've Ever Read: ""Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece"" adorns the cover of this edition, and it deserves it, ...kinda.I've tried many times to read this over the years, but could never get past the first few pages. You are bombarded with so many weird names of things that it's easy to get overloaded, and put it down. But this time, I decided to power through that first chapter, and shortly thereafter I was hooked. I've never read such a good blend of story, science, and philosophy. With characters so layered, and plots so intertwined, it was seriously one of the best books I've ever read. But it didn't live up to itself. It felt like the author spent decades composing the first half of the book, making it perfect, and then rushed the last half to meet a deadline in a few months. I may not read it cover to cover again, but I will probably read the first part many times, and be quoting passages from it like sacred text.

"Why does everything have to have a label?: GoJoe, as said before is not for everyone. For those who want fast food, instant everything, or cheap thrills this film is not for them.People who cannot ""get"" this movie probably also do not like Ikebana (Japanese flower arrangement), or Cha-no-yu (Tea Ceremony), practice martial arts and meditation or anything that takes patience and a deep spiritual understanding.If one understands Japanese culture and mind, then this picture has great significance. Meticulous detail oriented movies as this need a deeper look and an understanding of symbology such as represented in like films.This is a beautiful and rare look into imagination and spirit that the director has gifted us with and I for one, will enjoy it many times.For those who did not ""get"" it, watch it until you do.

Sodium benzoate is a known carcinogenic additive which, when eaten or applied to the skin, gets transported to the liver, where it is supposed to be filtered, and expelled in urine, but the damage gets done before that process is completed.Sodium benzoate chokes out your body's nutrients at the DNA cellular level by depriving mitochondria cells of oxygen, sometimes completely shutting them down.

Sub-par plot (An evil queen wants a jewel) And even the fight scenes were drug out. Nielsen is so frail that everyone is pulling their punches, sword blows, etc. So, it really slows down the action. Maybe if she didn't have a bigger sword than Arnold she could fight a little better.And the evil queen? She was in the first Conan movie! I thought she was WAY hotter than Red Sonja!If you want to know why they didn't make a Conan 3, watch this movie. Bad all around.

"dishonest reviews: The previous review claims that this book is the work of a misguided Marxist. The pages devoted to Marx in this text number 4 out of 527. The sentence quoted in the review to prove it was a defense of outdated Marixism is accurate, except for one thing----there is a break in the quote with the end of the sentence occuring three pages after the beginning of the sentence. The two parts have nothing to do with each other. My my, it appears that some people have too little to do.

"My Own Fault: Alas, it's my own fault for buying a cookbook it turns out I'll probably never use. Seduced by a review in a major publication, I broke my two self-imposed rules about buying cookbooks. Never buy one by a chef and/or restaurant owner and never buy without looking first. But the review was so warm and enthusiastic, I went straight to my computer and ordered it. Would that I had read both the reviewers' and readers' comments first. Then I would have known I would not be at all interested in the first 52 pages. Having cooked simple but good food for almost half a century, there's not much I don't know about kitchen tools and basic techniques. Judy Rodgers is, indeed, a good writer, but if I want to read about one's formative years in the cooking field, I'll look for a memoir. Then, too, there's the early salting recommendation which informs many of the recipes. I strive to reduce sodium in my cooking, not increase it. Perhaps I shall give it to a daughter or daughter-in-law.

"Very Sappy but Appealing: The Notebook is...sappy, unrealistic, romantic and everybody wants to say ""ugh, it's SO cheesy!"" but everybody ends up liking it even though it IS very very sappy. It's a guilty pleasure but they make this movie in a way that gets you into it and feeling not so bad about liking it. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this film (Rachel is absolutely gorgeous). They DID win best kiss at the MTV movie awards. Haha. It's a great romantic film to watch with your boyfriend/girlfriend os bunch of girlfriends. Guys will say ""oh I was dragged to see it with my girlfriend"" but secretly they will like it (hah). Don't watch it with people who will be like ""this is SO unrealistic!"" the entire time. It really ruins it because you KNOW it won't be realistic. It's just the ""most romantic movie"" ever!

"ESCAPE from locks up, freezes, and crashes!: If you or your kids want to play a fun computer game, DON'T buy this latest game from LucasArts because clearly it was rushed into production for the holiday buying season. The software is very, very buggy and prone to freezing and locking up your system. You'll spend many, many hours of your time in futile efforts to make the game work. And, believe me, those efforts will be futile. Shame on LucasArts for putting such a shoddy piece of programming out in the market place.

"Manufacturing Defects: I have been shipped 3 of these planers by Amazon. On the first one, the adjustable (forward) part of the base was not square with the blades and fixed base. This resulted in an inability to make even cuts. I sent it back. The second one had exactly the same problem. The third one, which was supposedly checked by Amazon before being sent, was not quite as bad but still off. I took it to the Dewalt service center. They still have it. While this planer looks good on paper because of its power and features, like many DeWalt items it is overpriced. It is also apparently poorly manufactured. Even if they correct the problem you have to wonder about the quality control process. The dust bag is also a little strange and overpriced. I am tired of making trips to the post office, service center, e-mail site and etc. Pick another brand and buy it in person.

I was a bit skeptical at first, but the ability to dial the bass level without reaching under the desk and tweaking a bass control on the subwoofer is very, very convenient. And this alone puts these speakers a notch above the JBL monsoon thing-a-ma-bobs.

"Overdubs SUCK!!: Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD version of Donington. They aren't overdubbed with other audio tracks. For instance, during Shoot to Thrill, Brian screams something, but his microphone is on his belt. During Back in Black. He says ""hey mama"" but his mike is no where near his mouth. One of the solos doesn't line up during Fire Your Guns. Thunderstruck even sounds different. There are lots of differences in the US DVD. I don't have time to name them all. The undoctored versions of the show also LOOK DIFFERENT. The show took place near a storm, but on the US DVD, there aren't any storm clouds. The sound is great, but its not from Donington. The original video and audio was fine. They should've left it alone. I strongly discourage the buying of this DVD. Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD to get the full effect of the show.

The direction was great, the storyline was even better! The movie basically deals with the whole Muslims being hated upon in India and how some decide to join the evil side.It's the type of movie that keeps you involved in the story, and makes you interested right till the end.

The instructions for making selections must be far separated from the actual tasks described - I could not find it.

"OK: What really smells about this game is the the fact that to save it you have to write down a really long password on a piece of paper and then type it all in the next time you want to play. And it's hard to steer the plane and you can easily crash into the sea without even noticing.I also don't like how every time you have to destroy a ship or refuel they turn it into a ""mission"". For example when early in the game you have to keep shooting at a ship until it sinks, but you have to be in a certain range on the map so when you enter the range the screen fades out and then in and your repositioned to face at the ship and when your done the same thing happens. It would have been much cooler if you could have just approached shot at it and turned around on your own.Probably the one thing that I like most about the game is if you miss the explosion it shows up on your little screen inside the cockpit or when you fire a missile.

"The most overwritten book I've seen in years: This is a perfect example of today's extremely overwritten book. This book should have been half of its 580 page length. The overall story idea was good, but the execution -- the endless minutiae, the overkill on the themes of the upperclass black -- just turned into a complete mess. The hokey cliffhangers that formed the basis for ending almost every chapter were so amateurish and formulaic I was actually embarrassed for the author.What's become of today's editors? Why don't they edit (and cut) anymore? What's become of the single detail that commutes volumes about a situation, a character? This was an assault on my patience. I had to bail out after getting half-way through it. Guess I'll have to wait for the movie version to find out what happened.

"Fast&Easy missed content and correct explanation: Far from an average book, the author just compiled some essencial stuff and commented (poorly) some code, repeating over and over again the same lines like ""this creates an object of..."" and skip other lines much more important for statements where type cast (e.g.) is present. Also, the ""on-line shop"" she advertise as ""Develop an Oline Store!"" is nothing more than MS's ""GrocerToGo"" sample and even on this sample, her comments to some code lines aren't enought to explain the inner works of that shopping cart classes, she skip again some crucial lines, maybe because she can't understand what they mean. That shopping cart code comments also end in rush (maybe she just wanted to finish the book quick). My two stars goes to the effort in collecting the content.

"They leak, stink, and cause rashes: People kept telling me to try Pampers because they hold a lot of pee. We primarily use cloth diapers and our cloth diapers work well for nighttime (11 hours) but sometimes I just hate waking up to that ammonia stink. I decided to try some different kinds of disposables to see if I could find a brand that would work all night without a change. We tried Seventh Generation and Nurtured by Nature, and they work off and on. I thought I would finally give some Pampers a try and see if the package was right. It says these are good for 12 hours. Not for us! They leak worse than the chlorine-free disposables and stink like powder. My son's closet (where these are stored) now has a stinky powdery smell. Some people might like this smell, but to me it smells bad. I decided to use them up by using them during the day and they gave my son a horrible rash.Never. Again.

These two books do an excellent job of not focusing on simply retelling the stories of Jackie's life but examning her life and the choices she made.

"Regarding the duplex option: This is just a quick comment rather than a full review.Printing in duplex mode (both sides) takes more than double the time of single sided printing. The sheets do not come out printed on both sides. Instead, sheets come out initially printed on one side, but right before a sheet is released in the output tray, it is ""retracted"" back inside the printer to print the back side then it is completely ejected printed both sides. So the sequence is: out-in-out which takes close to 2.5 times single sided printing.At least, all this process is done automatically versus printers where you have to print odd pages first, re-insert them in the paper tray, then print the even pages in reverse order.

"poor quality backpack, don't buy...: I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again.

The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website.

"One of Koontz's best books ever!!: I have read many of his novels, including Intensity, Lightning, Night Chills, and Watchers. Like in Lightning he puts the a paradoxical idea into the plot; time travel in Lightning and different demintions in From the Corner of his Eye. Of all of Koontz's novels I rate this one up at the top of my list of favorites, with Intensity and Lightning. I have seen some of the miniseries's adapted from Koontz's novels, and I believe this novel should be the next one. I have read in other reviews that only the beginning of the novel is good, for after the first 100 pages the novel is slow, but if you love Koontz's books you will not care. The book is as fast moving as a 600 page novel can be. Also do not let the length of the book stop you from reading it, for it moves quickly. All in all I rate this as one of my all time favorite novels, not just Koontz novels but all novels.

"A wonderful success story: The story of Paul Potts is one of those heart warming tales that show that one can beat the odds through hard work and by sticking to it against adversity. If you are unfamiliar with his story, you should check out the YouTube clips.As for this CD, it is good, and his talent shows through, but I was disappointed because I would have liked more a classic selection - and particularly more Opera - and that is from someone who is not a particular Opera Fan (I've always thought it okay, but...). His performance on Britain's Got Talent opened up large number of people to Opera, and so I would have liked more examples of it, or even other more traditional tunes (The Impossible Dream?) etc. Still, having said that, he does carry off even the most modern of music beautifully, taking songs that I thought were cheesey and turning them into something I very muched enjoyed. I will definately look at his future albums, an would love to see him in person.

"Seventh heaven: Lovely collection of music! Many pieces I already knew but would not have been able to play them all together; this CD has done that for me. I would have liked even more of the mandolin pieces playing some Italian favorites. This instrument is particularly beautiful (the mandolin) and is so Italian and mediterranean. Lovely vocalists for the arias of some of the nicest operas, too! It was all very beautiful and relaxing to listen to and I felt my self reminiscing the few times I spent in Tuscany and other parts of Italy. Thank you!

"Best film ever made.: I saw this film when I was about twelve years old and after watching it again and again and again I have to still say it is the best film ever made point blank! It still holds up to everything in its genre that is out there. It is crazy ironic that John Carpenter's The Thing almost ruined his career and is and always will be his best work. If you don't have it - buy it!!! Now!!!!

"This is Worth Seeing: I saw this video in a college media library. I was searching through 1,435 videos on a computer and I ran across this one. I've always admired Carmen Miranda (but not a big fan) and liked her music as well. I love traditional Samba, so this picture was a treat for me. I'm also quite historical, and I love documentary films that have old newsreels, home movies, etc. in them. I really liked this video a lot. I've never seen much Carmen Miranda. I've read about her, however. Fascinating lady. If you're nuts over Samba, Brazil, or Carmen, this is a video for you.

"Not meant for a thin 6-year old!: Our 6-year old wants to be a policeman when he grows up. He could not wait to get this belt. We had purchased the police uniform earlier. The first time I ordered the belt, it got lost in the mail so he had to wait almost a month to get it. When it finally arrived, he could have wrapped it around his waist 3 times it was so long. It is made of very thin vinyl and does not hold up very well to having holes punched in it. It is less than 4 weeks old and probably won't make it through the rest of the month.

"Disgusting: When I originally read The Mandalorian Armor, the series seemed ok, with only minor inconsistincies. Now reading the Slave Ship, my opinion of K.W. Jeter is falling rapidly. With major inconsistinces on every page, and with a fairly poor plot, the Slave Ship rates very low in my opinion. The only good thing about it is that it's a difference from the battle after battle X-Wing series (which were far better than the Slave Ship).

"Gotta be one of the best watches out there for less than $500: I've had my monster for at least 6 months now and loving it. I get a LOT of compliments and people noticing the orange. Most of all I am impressed by the quality of what you get for $150.... it's hard to think of another non electronic, retail item of this level of craftsmanship for that price point. I'm sure they are out there but they are few and far between.Anyway...great watch, durable, good looking, and I'm sure it'll still be running long after me. This orange monster actually replaced a Casio automatic dive watch that I bought new in 1982, and I only replaced it because I liked the orange face on the Monster. The old watch is still running strong.You can't go wrong with this....

"Not really great as a belt clip product: But then again - you don't really want to walk around w/ a cell phone, handspring, and other stuff hanging from your pants! Not me at least.Why I like this product: I slip my handspring in - and throw it in my backpack, suitcase, anywhere and I don't worry about it - it keeps the screen as safe as anything can and it's Durable.To take it out w/ 1 hand as was commented below - not so difficult - my only real complaint is that once you take it off - there's nowhere to stick it. I wish you could flip the visor and slide it back in so you're not left holding two things - I guess that's where the belt clip comes in handy!Anyways, if you're a student w/ a backpack - or just don't want to always be worried about breaking your visor - this is the thing to get.If you're worried about style - go get a simple/chic leather fold over case. (I use both)

I'd have loved more puzzles with symbol/picture answers or answers where you have to squeeze an entire word into one box. There are a few of those here, but mostly straightforward puzzles. I think it's probably challenging enough for the average puzzler, but if you're a die-hard puzzle fan, you might be bored.

"Save your money and buy better: Just reviewed http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G8EKIA/ the receiver so now for the speakers. The speakers sound like they are underwater. All low-end, no middle or high end. I disabled the bass amplification on my stereo, and cranked the high end up. This did nothing. I think the smaller speaker portion is blown out. Something is not right. I tested this with multiple receivers so it's not on the signal production end. This sucks. Both the receiver and the speakers were bunk.

"It's a fraud.: ""The Traveller"" will probably be a better film than it is a novel, because presumably a team of writers who don't have to hide behind a pen name will discard the terrible dialogue, and a crack team of Hollywood technicians will create passable images where before there were only descriptions like ""He also owned a Moto Guzzi V11, a powerful Italian bike that had a shaft drive and a powerful engine.""

".....not quite: I loved ""Triplets..,"" and I was eagerly awaiting Chomet's latest work. The drawings are charming, the theme poignant, the homage to Tati touching, but all in all, the film doesn't hold together, the problem being that the overall narrative falls flat. The project was daring, combining the two visions of one of the great comic geniuses of the last century, and a very talented filmmaker whose best work is probably yet to come. But not unlike Kubrick and Spielberg's 5 endings ""AI,""two visions do not necessary spoil the broth, but probably confuse it.

"The best just got better!: I have had a couple of pairs of iGrado's for the past 3 years or so. The cable they came with are very thin and do not handle wear. I've been looking for cable replacements (yes, the iGrado's are worth salvaging) but decided it was cheaper and easier to just buy new ones. Well to my surprise, the new ones are better. The cable is much thicker with a thick jacket. The Y split in the cable is much more rugged and the plug is a nice L shape now. I also noticed the headband is wider and a little more comfy. Best of all, they sound the same--GREAT.Do not be fooled by other reviews of behind-the-head headphones that get 4 and 5 stars--they sound nowhere near as good as the iGrado's. If you want good bass and a great sound from top to bottom in the behind-the-ear form factor, the iGRADO's are THE BEST. Don't spend half to ultimately be unsatisfied.

"An incoherent mess: Despite the fact that the little bit of plot that's here is pretty simple, Reiji Saiga's poor writing, awkward pacing, and dreadful layouts make it almost impossible to follow. Things seem to constantly happen for no reason to bland, cliched characters. And if you're hoping that it at least has decent action, it's almost impossible to figure out what's going on in the fights, which are brief and usually only finish with only one character ever making contact with the other. This is up there with Bomber Girl as one of the most dreadful manga series ever translated into English. Avoid.

"Solid performer: I purchased two of these projectors two years ago. They have worked very well for us, using each on a 6'x8' screen. At that size they are not dazzling bright, but very usable in a lit room. They have been very reliable. The one we use more (now has 1000 hours on it) complained that its air filter needed cleaning, but still worked fine.The one annoying thing about this model is that the only way to switch inputs is to put up with a blue screen while it rotates through all the inputs (there are about a half dozen). If you switch to a second input, and then back, you see all six inputs. If you have more than two signals coming in, it gets worse, because you have to wait until it finds a signal you don't want, displays the picture, and then press the 'Source' button on the remote TWICE before it starts looking for another input.I would buy this unit again.

It is difficult to find entertaining/uplifting Christian fiction which is neither ""preachy"" or ""saccharin"".

"Road Trip through Life, Love, and America: In The Long Run is an inspirational literary work, which not only motivates the reader, but also takes them down memory lane of two-different American generations. The weaving of Civil War History and 20th Century Culture, as told by Josh, gives the reader the opportunity to remember, relate, and compare two impactful times during the history of America.Growing up with Josh and running with him in one of the ultimate human tests, the Marathon, provided a great look into the American spirit and growing up in Midwestern America.

NOW first edition hard cover books on Kindle are running between $13.00 and $15.00 so any savings using a Kindle are now gone. Additionally many book publishers are not supporting eBooks with a new release which could take up to 90 days before you can get it on Kindle (i.e. James Patterson, plus others) and then you still will pay about the same price if you just ordered the hard cover book when it was first released.

For those wondering, this item IS compatible with the new MacBook and MacBook pro line. While it only includes software/drivers for the PC, the product is truly plug n play for Mac users. Just plug it in, configure bluetooth in System Prefs on your machine and you're ready to go.

"OK, not really worth it: I'm not sure what I was expecting with a 3-ingredient cookbook, but I found that many of the recipes included prepared ingredients (i.e., a jar of Cheez Whiz, or a packet of onion soup) in order to stay within a three-ingredient total. Again, this is to be expected when you are only ""allowed"" 3 ingredients, but I probably will never use the cookbook. I should have bought a 5-ingredient book!

"JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK - Not for Collectors: If I wanted a receipe book I would have purchased one, 69 out of 215 pages were related to Beanies, the rest of the book is a waste of time. I really was looking for a good collector book, like the last one. I will never purchase a book from this author again. I hope they understand that people who want to collect don't want stupid receipes included in a collectors edition book. Again I ssy this book is a big waste of MONEY. Don't waste your money.

"Waiting for Godot: Contrary to the popular belief that this is a bunch of BS, I find it to be one of the most honest and moving insights to humanity. It may seem redundant and boring within the first five pages, but this play demands us to ask more of ourselves in seeing its depth. The ever-present way they wait for Godot symbolizes the continual hope that there is in searching for meaning in the middle of life's absurdities.

"Nice - but it is a dramatization, not an unabridged audio book: I got this in order to have a version of Wind in the Willows with separate tracks (unlike the monstrous 2-part file I was able to purchase on iTunes).This version, however (and I imagine I just didn't look close at the description) is not an audio book, but a dramatization. It is fun to listen to for me (I am very familiar with the book - having read it several times as a child), but for my 5-year old daughter it can be harder to follow than the straight-up audio book.

"bizarre: This is not so much a novel as an artifact. Much of it is practically incomprehensible due to a great deal of English-public-school vocabulary that few people living will be able to understand. There are pages of descriptions of ""footer,"" including sentences such as, ""The last ball he placed in front of short-leg for a single,"" and ""The next ball was full pitch to leg,"" but there are almost no details of the boys' academic studies or of the rest of their lives. The writing style is very terse and choppy, and the boys have no personalities. The jerkiness, the lack of explanations, and the lack of any character development at all, make reading this book a bizarre experience.

"This fine raw-boned ANIME is not a US vampire TV show: The bozos below are ranting on about some mainstream US TV vampire show that got canned.This anime is not at all related to that network show. It opens with two mountain climbers boffing some hot Sherpa ladies on their way up Everest. Drinking, smoking, sex, adventure... this is a testosterone flooded over-the-top extravaganza that somewhat to our surprise both my wife and I are really enjoying. For those of us that grew up living & breathing the space race in the '60s, a show that says you can get up there with enough guts and will really warms our hearts.It's X-file conspiracies, Kimball Kinnison space opera, Tom Swift genius engineer... all in one. So far it has the emotional introspection of The A-Team, so it's not on the shoujou side of the fence, but both a guy who sobbs through Fruits Basket and a gal who loves Patlabor Mobile Police find this to be a primo series.

The third time Jack Nicholson's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you're torn between wishing they'd just kill him already and wishing they'd kill you instead so you don't have to sit through anymore of this crap.Save your time and your money, turn around and walk away from this one.

I loved the way Ms Ford weaved bits and pieces of the Montgomerys and Randols (from her previous books, ""For Always and Forever After"")into the storyline. Donald is a gorgeous, famous NBA star and Taylor is the down-to-earth beauty he falls in love with. He practically moves heaven and earth to win her trust and love. The MANY delectable steamy love scenes left me breathless. Once again, Bette Ford delivers..this was pure satisfaction!

And the music was great, he danced around a lot, and I enjoyed it.

"A neglected but solid murder mystery, ghost, WWII movie!: When I read the cover for this DVD, it said ""cross between Poltergeist and U-571."" I found this to be a very rough over simplification. I braced myself for something along the lines of ""Ghost Ship"" (blood and gore). I was very pleasantly surprised to find myself trying to solve a murder mystery with supernatural overtones. I would rate this film at four and a half stars and say it has been overlooked by the general public. It is an American-British collaboration with some very solid performances and chemistry between roles. The story boils down to what a sailor calls a ""malediction"" in the movie, a wrongful death with a spirit left to haunt the ship seeking justice. If you enjoy the mental challenge of adding up the clues as they appear one by one, you will definitely enjoy this movie.

"The Problem with Reprints: As the earlier reviewer pointed out, this Dover edition is a reprint of the orginal Durand score issued in the first decade of the 20th century. The downside of a reprint edition, especially from French publishers, who had a very distinctive engraving style, is that stems and staves tend to disappear in places, which makes it hard to read. Even so, Dover does a great service by making this masterpiece (I don't use that term lightly!) available at a reasonable price. If you really want to have a clean modern engraving, you'll have to shell out more than $100 for the cloth-bound critical edition.

"very disappointed: I love these bottles for my son, i usually just buy them in the store, but since they were less then they are in the store, i figured why not. But when I ordered them, I was under the impression that they were going to be the bottles in the picture, since there is no option to choose which bottles you would like to order. I received designed bottles for girls, when i emailed the seller she refused to refund all of my money and told me simply to ""give them to a friend"" or to ship them back and I would be refunded half my money, which is completely pointless since the cost of shipping would probably be the same as not sending them back at all. Not worth ordering these bottles & it was a waste of my money. DO NOT order bottles from this sender. Colors really do vary, since I got pink and purple butterfly bottles for my son. The bottles are great but don't waste your money and just buy them from the store.

"Quit Editing: I don't own this DVD but based on the reviews I will not be purchasing it. I orginally taped this concert when it was on MTV years ago. Because my TV was a piece of junk at the time, the sound quality was terrible but I still have the tape. I ended up buying the official VHS tape when they released it but found that they had edited out some of the things that were shown on MTV when the concert first aired. Overall the VHS release still kicks... but I was somewhat disappointed. Now it sounds like they have edited out even more for the DVD. I am writing because I would like to see a multiple DVD un-edited version of this concert in it's entirety. I don't care what it costs. Put everything in there. People will buy it.

"Isn't it just pleasent when human nature gets in the way, again?: I found this sequel to be okay. Alot of the parts are just talking and no action, and some parts are a bit boring. But otherwise, it was a pretty good book. Not on my list of favorites, but definetly worth reading. Very well written. I found myself wanting to hollar at the people for being so stupidly selfish (human nature getting in the way...again.) I found myself wondering why they didn't discuss their options in the very begining, but then it wouldn't have been a very good story if everything was all happy cheery. The book was a very satifiying sequel. I wasn't left wondering like I am with many other sequels. If you liked the first book, then read this sequel. You don't get left with too many questions at the end and it is a quick read.

The kind you use to connect a computer to a printer or a camera. Called Amazon, which quickly replaced the cables. After all these years I've purchased from Amazon, and many, many products of all types, I figured anybody is entitled to a mistake now and then. Within 2 or 3 days, I got the replacements. Exactly the same wrong Belkin USB device cables. I called Amazon and said I know they couldn't make the same mistake twice. The product is wrong on the shelf in their Indiana Jones type warehouse, no doubt and whoever pulls the merchandise doesn't know an RCA from a USB. The service rep said she put in a ""bin check"" to see what the problem is.I'm sure the cables are fine, if you can get the ones you ordered.

"Absent Of Any Distinguishing Personality: The skies were clear and blue on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and yet there was something in the air. Hillary Clinton's descriptions of important events are akin to looking at a painting that has been edited by photoshop. Her bloodless image of America and her life experiences in it over the last fifty years will leave you yawning. There is no emotion in her prose, only clean typeface absent of any distinguishing personality. If you wonder why she lost the 2008 Primary to Barack Obama, this work of carefully chosen memories is a good indication. If there is a real Hillary Clinton, she is so hard to find that even her editor struggled to craft the semblence of a real person. It's a shame really. For a woman who has done so much for the country, she really should find the courage to admit her flaws without faking it.

This is Oshry's translation from Hebrew to English of his original five-volume compilation of the responsa he gave in the Kovno Ghetto. In the English version, nearly all the halakhic argumentation is removed and the questions and answers are much simplified. It's still a wonderful, moving read, but if you want to follow Oshry's legal reasoning, you'll need to read the original in Hebrew.

"Made in Romania!: Do they even have hunting or know anything about it in Romania? They cleary don't know much about it which explains why you run out of breath after five seconds in the game and have to walk painfully slow 90% of the time. Also you can walk around while you shoot which my dad would kick my ass for doing. It turns out Cabela's Big Game Hunter, Cabela's Deer Hunt 2004, and Cabela's Dangerous Hunts for the Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC versions are all made in Romania. No wonder Sunstrom, the originator of the game went out of business here in Indiana. I was so pissed I returned this pile of garbage. Any self respecting American should do the same, or not buy any of these games in the first place. You think they could at least make a hunting game in the states. I'm going to wait for Deer Hunter on the Playstaion 2 which is made in the good ole U.S.A. plus the PC version is way better than Cabela's.

"As Satisfying As Watchers, Brought Be To Tears: First off, I admit I am HUGE Koontz fan; his writing is phenomenal. I have read nearly all his books. Ever since I have read Watchers, it continued to be the best book I ever read, until now. One Door Away From Heaven is a COMPLETE equal to Watchers, if not better, and when you near the end a melancholy sadness emerges in you, for you can't bear to put the book down, yet you don't want to finish it. You feel as if you are right there with the characters experiencing everything with them. When I finished the book, it brought me to tears, which no book has ever done. This book is truly inspiring and no description could do it justice.

"Good Shaver: For the last five years I used a Panasonic wet/dry shaver; it was excellent for all but the last year (got noisy and did not shave as well as it did, even with new blades), so I searched for a replacement. The Braun is a dry shaver but it's really very good. It's relatively quiet (even though it uses a vibration technology to raise whiskers), shaves close and is very comfortable to use. I was surprised that I don't need any pre-shave to get a good shave and although fast, I don't get any razor burn from shaving longer when I want a really close shave. The pop-up trimmer is the best I have ever used and the cleaning station (which I had doubts about) works very well. It's somewhat expensive but worth the cost. Whereas I don't know how well less expensive razors work, my Braun works well on my heavy beard and boney jawline.

"Not his best work: I picked up this book because I had read ""The Names of the Dead"" and found it a very affecting work about the Viet Nam war, a topic of too few good novels. This one is just not up to the same standard. Karla Faye Tucker meets Stephen King... it's like the TV movies that come out within a week of some sensational tabloid crime. I was not lead to care very much about Marjorie, or anyone else in this book. Nor was I lead to understand her. If, as she says, she accepted Jesus into her life, I am hard put to see how. This book is a gripping page-turner, but definitely ""summer reading"". If you really wanted to see into the life and heart of a killer, read Norman Mailer's ""The Executioner's Song"" about Gary Gilmore, and then read the devastating ""Shot in the Heart"" by Gary's brother Mikal.

So i guess that is not a really good reson for not liking the book. I'm not to sure that i liked Steinbecks way of writing. He would have odd chapters in there that didn't go with the story line. It threw me off. Then again some of those chapters were were kinda cool.If you are tired of reading the odinary kinda book and are looking for a change i say read Cannery Row. I myself woould not recomend this book.

"Great Family Entertainment: Finally, a film that can be enjoyed with the entire family present. It's a shame that it's getting harder to find solid quality entertainment that does not need tons of special effects and elaborate hype that ultimately leaves you disappointed. Treat yourself to a really special film. It is very refreshing to say the least.

"Mediocre: The movie is is much like Masters of the Universe, a low budget deviation from the source material. It is at best mediocre and short. The plot and speical effects are at best of a TV-Movie variety and James Marsters part seems it was cut down quite a bit. I would say only to rent it but never to purchase it.

"A delight to read and filled with practical advice: As I move through my journey of raising my daughter this book came at a wonderful time. The author knew the joys of raising two daughters and provided many, many pieces of practical advice on loving, providing guidance, and establishing a warm, safe and structured environment in which to raise one's daughter.I look forward to sharing the book with others lucky enough to be the father of a daughter (or two).

"BEST ALBUM EVER!: This album is amazing! Andrew McMahon, also singer for Something Corporate, brings his amazing talent to this new band. Still with his melodious voice, McMahon shows a softer side with Jack's Mannequin. This album is like a journal inside the world of this great musician and with hits like ""The Mixed Tape"", this CD becomes etched in your mind. If you like Something Corporate, definately check out this band! If you don't like Something Corporate, but like fantastic vocals and addicting songs, then Jack's Mannequin is the band for you!

"Not very convincing: This book started out well. The author touched on Near Death Experiences and the like which was quite interesting. As the book unfolds, however, the author speaks of certainty about spritual guides blocking information and of Council of Elders existing in the spirit world. A bit far fetched. Also, it also seems as though the author refers to the experiences of the client under hypnosis as if they are happening in real time, when hypnosis is supposed to be drawing on the client's memories. Afraid I gave up on this book about midway.

"Not worth your time!: I am usually a big fan of Cornwell's; I have read all her Scarpetta novels and was looking forward to seeing the same page-turner writing applied to a real, historical case. I was sorely disappointed. _Portrait of a Killer_ was 400 pages of asides, with occasional installments of an interesting story that could have been told in 100. Perhaps a reader truly obsessed with the Ripper case would appreciate the extensive biographical information about Sickert's father-in-law and other quasi-relatives and the historical details about art exhibits, etc, during the time period of the killings. For most, it is too much detail and not relevant enough to hold a reader's attention. I finished the book, hoping for some suspense, but there was no climax. It seems that Cornwell was simply told that 400 pages was enough, so she stopped there. Thank goodness.

"Love my T-Fal convection/toaster oven!: The first think I made in it was lamb chops... they were perfection. The combination of ""convection"" and ""toaster"" is great for cooking meat because it seals the meat and keeps it juicy. If you like your meat very well done, you might want to lower the temperature and cook it a little longer. Batter recipes might also need adjusting in the same way.The only issue I have is the size. I wish it were bigger, even an inch each direction would help. It's been a little hard to find pans to fit in it. That is usually because the pan measurements don't include the ""lip"" around the edge of the pan. The curved design of the door may also make some pans less compatible.Aside from the size issue, I like everything else about this oven. I'd buy another!

"Greatest Love Story Ever Told: Hi, I loved this book. I read it many many years ago when it first came out. It gave me a deeper revelation of God's love for each of us and it continues to bless me each time I read it.

"Looks like a bad reenactment: The movie ""Cross of Iron"" is based on the novel by Willi Heinrich. Heinrich's novel is a very well written account of warfare on the eastern front from the perspective of a German non-com. Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" is unfortunately, is a low budget western with homo-erotic undertones. The ""German"" characters look like participants at a bad reenactment. Hell's Angels look more like real German Soldiers than the characters in this film.The dialogue in the film makes me wonder whether Peckinpah was drunk while he was directing this film as the acting and dialogue is overly melodramatic and ludicous.The creditable acting of Coburn, Schell and Mason are not enough to salvage this dreadful film.

"Can't depend on it working when you want it to.: I bought the Elph (at about twice the current price) for my wife and one for each of my three daughters! My wife's worked at first and then would work inconsistently (usually NOT just when you wanted the graduation picture, prom picture, etc.). I sent it into the company three times. The first time they couldn't find anything wrong, the second time they fixed something and charged me, the third time they couldn't find anything wrong. In the mean time my daughter's cameras started having the same problem--sometimes they would work and other times they wouldn't! I don't know what to do about it--I don't feel like shipping them in again as this didn't help. We now have four relatively expensive cameras that are undependable!!

"Disappointment: I was first introduced to Omar Tyree with his novel ""Leslie"" and I absolutely loved it! I then decided to check out other novels he had written. I read ""Flyy Girl"" first which, I liked as well and followed it with ""For The Love of Money"", which was a Big Disappointment! They always say sequels are bad and this novel proved that theory. The novel starts off with the end of the story and in the middle of the novel right when it is going to climax you realize the connection between the beginning and the end and loose interest because you already know the ending of the novel. The novel did not keep my interest and seemed rather long. This novel could have been summed up in one chapter and used for the Prologue to ""Boss Lady"". After reading ""For The Love of Money"", I am not interested in reading the sequel ""Boss Lady"" at all! Why make a sequel to something that is so bad?

"How did I get by without this?: Well, sometimes you do things one way, don't like doing them, but figure that's the only way to do it. Thank goodness, that's not the case with cleaning a pellet stove. It can be a dusty, nasty business, especially if you clean the stove while there's still heat inside it: this makes the fine particles rise with the heat. Soon you have a thin layer of ash all over the house. Not nice.Enter the ash vacuum. It's louder than a jet plane operating in your front pocket, but it does the job of cleaning the stove without letting ANY dust out. You know how regular vacuums blow a little bit of dust out when you turn them on? Not this thing. It's a really ingenious design.While you can vacuum warm ash, it's not designed for sucking up flames, so you do still have to let the stove cool down some before you clean it. But with this thing, your stove will be cleaner, run better, and burn brighter. What, you're still thinking about it? Come on...I wish I'd gotten this sooner!

"Amazon...SHAME ON YOU: I wrote a negative review of this book. A 1-star review. It was removed. It was my opinion that this book is not so great. Whenever the author couldn't explain something he easily dismissed it. Basically, religion is made by man for man. Religion is believing in what someone else is telling you to believe. When someone in the modern world claims to speak with God, everyone thinks he/she is crazy, yet millions are so willing and gullible to believe it really happened in the distant past when man was more primitive and easily confused natural events for those of the supernatural. I finished this book with a very empty feeling.

"Unfortunately this writer's not a good storyteller: The writer's father and other ancestors may be good writers or storytellers, but Saira Shah certainly isn't. This book is a unstructured enumeration of detailed events during the writer's travels to her home country, but it lacks to give the larger picture the reader is looking for. Events or stories described in the book sometimes just span 1 sentence or 1 paragraph. Everytime I asked myself: ""what was the point of writing this ?"". I was also hoping to get a better insinght in the regions past and present, and the book almost failed completely. It's arrogant to call this book ""memoirs"" when the writer was barely 35 or 40 (my best guess) when she wrote it. There's just not enough substance and the reader leaves the book with a great hunger. The editors have done a bad job coaching the writer and editing the book.

"Mirwais' music rocks!: I bought this album based solely on Mirwais' work on Madonna's ""Music"" and it is really good. Unfortunately the album only has nine tracks and one of them already appeared on Madonna's album. The only track that really blows is ""v.i"". ""Junkie's Prayer"" is really interesting giving us the interpretation of what a junkie would sound like if he/she was praying. The rest of the album is basically stuff Mirwais repeated on Madonna's album but ""Music"" was more commercial and radio-friendly. Madonna's album is not as risk-taking as Mirwais' ""production"" but it still sounds fresh and far from the boring Boy Band & Britney clones ... that plays on .... If any of these teen groups really want to see their careers last, they need to take the Madonna route and search for talent that will help them create musical landscapes that are unique and daring...like Mirwais!

I do agree that all the subjects that he brought up were valid, but he had no knew way of saying that ""This is something that shouldn't be feared."" And his tone came off as extremely biased to me. And I found that I could not sit and read his book for too long without getting bored.

This entire book could have been summed up in a two page listing of all the different subjects that are feared for the wrong reasons.

"A Little Disappointing :(: I must admit I was a little disappointed with this book, although the detail paid to Todd's music, the musicians with whom he worked is very thorough, and I did enjoy the inclusion of the various magazine reviews of his albums when they were first released, but I hope a biography is going to give me some insight into the person's LIFE - his music I have available to listen to! There was hardly any personal detail about Todd, and he seems like such an interesting person. I was really hoping to hear more about his relationship with Patti Smith, another favourite of mine, but she was only mentioned briefly three times, and none of it was related to anything she and Todd did together! But I know everyone has different expectations of a music biography, and I'm sure there will be plenty of people who don't care about the personal stuff and will certainly find it very informative :)Jo Segarra

The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didnt care much whether Ford found the ""Replicants"" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didnt make much impression on our society.I wound up skipping ahead on the downloaded CD to see what happened. I will not watch this film again or buy the CD. Ugh.

"Somebody Had To Go There: This is an audacious mockumentary that looks at a world where the South won the civil war. Following the premise to its conclusion is not necessarily a wholesome enterprise, and involves a pact with ""Our good friend Chancellor Hitler"" and other escapades. The greatest strength of the movie is the liberal dose of fake commercials that advertise everything from chattel insurance to GPS slave location. Few film-makers would be brave enough to tread here, and the difference between those popular novels where the south won the war and ""C.S.A."" where a complete racist society is recreated, is immense. If you sit through the complete mockumentary, the twist at the end is startling and worth the wait. Half of the racist commercials portrayed in the film are factually based, and food chains with names unprintable in this forum existed right up until the 1980s!

"Surprisingly Funny: What a happy man I was to have watched this film! I thoroughly enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The story line is typical chick flick but it's boistered by the comedic talents of all three women who are in this film: Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate and Selma Blair. Casting these three lovely ladies in this film was a smart move. The handsome Jason Bateman's rising star is in here too!Like most people, I am really picky when it comes to comedies. I will see almost any sci-fi flick but when it comes to comedies, I'm about as picky as you get.I personally think Christina Applegate stole this film from Cameron Diaz. Why Christina Applegate is not in more movies, I will never know, she is down right h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s. The road trip and bathroom scenes are worth at least a passing viewing alone. Not to mention the church scene and the last scene of the movie.I love it when a movie can make me laugh this hard! Watch and enjoy!

I ordered it in September and this is October- a little over a month since I got it. Now I am stuck with it unless I pay return postage. I like the way it heats the water and it is pretty looking, too bad the thermostat is broke. I would have accepted a replacement, but that option is not there now.

"Great medieval flavor: I bought this deck because I love the middle ages and it has a very British feel to it. Plus the photos of the cards I saw in the bookstore were very beautiful. The major arcana cards were my favorites in this deck.My primary issue with the deck is that many of the faces in the minor arcana look aggressive and cold. That disturbed me a little bit and I would often feel a funny vibe when I did readings with them. However, I had no such feelings when working with the Major Arcana because that aggressiveness was not as strong in these pictures.If you are not sure about whether this is the deck for you, find a new age shop or website where you can look at several pictures of the cards to see if you like the overall feel of them. Just make sure that it shows you minor arcana cards and not just the aces.In general, though, the images are colorful, well drawn and definately different than what you'd find elsewhere. Because of this uniqueness, the deck is well worth a look.

"Haven't had any problems.: It's possible that I have a slightly different model (mine says ""1019 BLOCKS"" on the front instead of ""64 MB MEMORY CARD""), but I think it's essentially the same card. I've had this card for about four years now, and while it occasionally says that the ""card could not be read, please put in a new card, etc."" when I first boot up PSO, the only inconvenience it's really given me is that I have to pull it, and then out and put it back in.I've never had any major corruption problems in the last four years, and I've used my Gamecube (and this card in particular) at least four times a week, for several hours a day. As always, do more research on this product before you buy it, but I'm just letting you know that not all people get faulty cards (or perhaps, have faulty Gamecubes).

"Worst camera ever; do not buy.: I researched before I bought this camera and based on the features and value, as well as a recommendation and photos I saw from another owner of the Sony, I purchased this camera. I am very disappointed in the clarity, quality and consistency of the photos. I have set, reset parameters and even taken the camera back to the store where I purchased it to have them figure out why the pictures have sections that are fuzzy. No one can explain it. I do not even take pictures anymore because I know they won't live up to my expectations of resolution, clarity or depth of field. I previously owned a Canon with less pixels and lost it, and replaced it with this one, which does not come near to the quality of the Canon. This one is going in the trash.

"Worth your time: Nancy wrote an excellent review so I won't repeat the contents of the DVD (definitely read her review before purchasing if you're on the fence). I am doing Shaun T's Insanity (9-week) workout, and I use Jackie's workout on my off day. It's a solid, total body workout. My balance is often challenged with it, but my balance isn't that great to start with.In my experience, some exercise DVDs have such a small amount of actual exercise that they're a waste of time. I don't want to spend the first ten minutes doing arm circles and hamstring curls. This DVD is not like that. You get to work quickly, and the exercises flow nicely through the video. She also has a nice-enough personality, not ""fake-y"" like some others (Jillian). So, I would say if you want to work out all of your major muscle groups and work on your balance, and do it all in about 30 minutes, you will like this DVD.

The stitching for the straps came undone, the zippers wouldn't close properly, and the stitching for the water bottle holders came undone. I couldn't return it to amazon because it was passed 30 days, and High Sierra told me to pay for shipping for a return that they ""may or may not be able to cover"".

"Great Idea, but Unreliable: When it works, it's great. Most of the parts are immersible (except, obviously, the controls), so cleanup is quick.Unfortunately, these units have a tendency for the control panel to show an error or just stop working altogether. There is a reset switch which will help sometimes, but not always. So, there you are: all ready to fry, and the fryer shuts down. The oil is hot, but it won't stay that way; I've found myself carefully moving the hot oil to a pot so that I could continue cooking.You can see the nightmares folks have had with customer support in the other comments on this page.So, I don't buy Euro-Pro any more.

"No one has a monopoly on suffering: It would seem that the world has been held hostage thinking one group or another deserves more because they have suffered more than anyone else. Our history books have misinformed us and downright lied about the experiences of so many people as if they did not exist. When we speak of genocide the first thing ringing in our ears is the Holacaust in Germany and what happened to 6 million Jews. What about the 20 million Armenians on April 24,1919 (or thereabouts). What about 9 million Africans drowned in the Middle Passage. How about the annihilation and almost termination of the indigineous people of the Americas. The importance of this book lies in taking a factual, first person, look at the other resident citizens of Germany who were also issued a death penalty under Nazi rule. Hopefully knowing the world wide experience of Genocide (still going on), we as people of the world can stop it.

"A real disappointment: When I was a very young girl I read some of the late-Victorian ""Elsie Dinsmore"" series (I was stuck at a great-aunt's house in the rain). This book comes as close as anything I've read since in combining surgary piety with an unlikely plot and turgid writing. I can only suppose that all those teachers who were raving about it were teaching in private Christian schools.The premise is nonsense but it might have been fun if treated light-heartedly. Children enjoy fantasy and improbable plots and if they are well-written such stories can teach important lessons about life. As it is, this book doesn't teach ""values"" -- it heavy-handedly and explicitly preaches the type of fundemental Christianity that may not be acceptable to many readers.I'm all in favor of clean writing and good values but I consider that books in which adult characters exclaim ""Praise Jesus"" should come with some kind of advisory.

"Excellent.: Reason 3.0 is a monster. Therefore I found it necessary to break things down into terms and concepts that were chewable...and found Reason 3 Power to be very successful in breaking ideas down into bite size chunks without giving me indigestion at any given time. Its very comprehensive and covers various aspects that will be understandable to both neophytes and experienced users alike. The only thing the booklet doesn't tell you is how to define your audio engineering process, which is obviously something that each engineer needs to find out for themselves. Anyways, it goes from the basic setup to the more advanced features detailing every aspect of Reason greatly improving chances for success with this monster of a program. Ultimately, the book is written by 2 people that understand music and technology very well and I gotta hand it to them, they did a damn good job of proving it.I would STRONGLY recommend this booklet to people that are just starting out in Reason 3.0

"A Smash Hit For NBC. Mr. Spielberg And Company Have Crafted A Unique Drama.: Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.When I saw the promo for this show, I though, ""A TV version of the film Chicago,"" but as I continued watching, I saw that it's more than that. It's Singin' In The Rain meets All About Eve coupled with a unique prespective on show business. Plus, it stars Debra Messing, Katherine McPhee (who is extradorinarily beautiful and has a lovely voice), Jack Davenport (Commadore Norrington in the Pirates Of The Carribean movies) and Academy Award winner Angelica Huston. Besides, Mr. Spielberg himself is behind this drama (he's an executive producer) and THAT, my friends, sealed the deal for me. Anything that has Mr. Spielberg has his name on (with the exception of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, Super 8 and the Transformers films, having had to sit through the abominable first installment) I'm willing to give a shot.

"Just watch Fox news and laugh at that: The war of liberty to Sean includes having the government run more processes without interference. He is an advocate of more laws about morality and restrictions. Sean's biggest arguement is that the liberals have no good solution to the problem other than communism (come on, really?). I don't know if allowing the CIA to run the country would be much different than communism. He's just playing off people's fears from the past (mostly indoctrination about the evil enemy) to try and keep a stranglehold to the future. Sean's liberty needs the government to be involved in every moral question except for big business. It's all restrictive except for those huge corporations and money holders.

"The legendary Slowhand: Although I prefer Clapton's earlier guitar driven works like ""Stepping Out"", ""Hideaway"", ""Have You Heard"" from the legendary ""Beano"" album and ""Crossroads"" from Cream, this album was what would become a stepping stone to his more laid-back experimental works like the classic ""Slowhand"" album. My favourite tracks included Big Bill Bronzy's ""Key to th Highway"" and Jimmie Cox's ""Nobody Knows You When You're Down And Out"". A supreme transformation, true to Clapton's innovative improvisation. I was a bit dissapointed that ""Blues Power"" was not in the album but it won't do justice to the album if it did since this is a love album. This is an album for circa 70s Clapton's fan.

Nothing compares to the Bostik Blue-Tac for lifting graphite to adchive highlights in drawings. I'm in the USA and this Bostik putty is only available in the UK. The only way to get it is order it online. If you take care to keep it clean, it lasts a long time. I'm still using some that I bought several years ago.

"Unfaithful and miscast version.: This is quite the worst ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" I have seen. It is nothing new to deviate from the Conan-Doyle story and although this doesn't do so often, it does it in pointless and unnecessary ways. The worst feature, however, is the miscasting of Holmes, who is so wooden he hardly registers at all, and Watson who is completely alien to Conan-Doyle's creation and dominates throughout as if he was the main character.If this is an attempt to de-construct the Holmes story you can keep it.

"Install Locks Up with Fatal Error: I purchased VS 11 after using version 9 because I had found some decent ratings for this upgrade on the internet and I was already familiar with VideoStudio and how it works. After receiving the application CD ROM I attempted to install the software, but after what appeared to be a successful install the setup installation froze during the final stages and then aborted with a Fatal Error message.

"What is the appeal of this movie?: I cannot understand how why this movie consistantly gets such high praise. It's honestly a pretty terrible movie... the acting is laughable (Willem Dafoe is at his absolute worst), the story is nothing spectacular... yes, it's incredibly violent, but there are lots of violent movies that actually have some level of intelligence in them as well, and a good number of them are ripped-off in this movie.If somebody, anybody, could explain to me the appeal of this generic movie and why it's so highly rated, please help me. Until then, I regret buying the hype about this movie.

"Poor Circuits text for undergraduate Engineering students: I'm a computer engineering student and have been studying this book for 3 months and I've concluded that it's impossble to learn from. In almost all of the examples, the author skip steps that are vital for students who have never analyzed circuits in such detail before. The reading is difficult to understand, even after reading each chapter two or three times. It's as if the authors wrote this text to impress their colleages. I'm fortunate that my professor explains the material faily well. I'm definitely going to sell this book back at the end of the semister and use the money to invest in a useful circuits text. I highly recommend you do not buy this book, I wish I never did.

"Keira Knightly Cannot Act: I was very interested in watching this movie but had to turn it off after the first 20 minutes or so due to the horrendous job of acting on the part of Keira Knightly. Her attempt to portray a psychologically damaged patient in a mental hospital was amateurish at best. It was like watching a bad high school stage production in which the immature actress completely overacts. What was so hard to watch was that she was so obviously acting - you try as a film viewer to suspend belief and get absorbed in the roles of the film. However, when the acting is so bad all you see is someone pathetically attempting to act and nothing more. My wife and I kept on looking at each other and shaking our heads before we finally threw in the white towel of surrender in order to spare us another minute of experiencing an actress way over her head and unable to bring the least bit of subtlety to what could have been an interesting film.

"Not what I expected: In one word, I would describe this album as just OK. I was expecting more since ""Lose My Breath"" was so catchy and upbeat. I'll admit that some of the songs are catchy, but honestly, none of them really stand out. The only songs that really catch my attention are the first single and ""Through With Love."" If they're smart, ""Through With Love"" will be the next single. Unfortunately, I've been hearing that ""Cater 2 U"" will be released. Why? Anyway, I'd suggest getting a burned copy of this one. I bought mine on sale. I guess that's a good thing. By the way, did anyone get the release with the bonus tracks? I bought my copy at Target and did NOT get the bonus CD. Now I'm stuck with extra track listings (on the sleeve) for a CD I don't have. Go figure.

"A Marilyn favorite: This was the first Marilyn movie I ever saw at the age of 13. Since then I have been a huge Marilyn fan(atic). This is one of her funniest movies (along with Some Like It Hot). Marilyn's innocense plays off her sexuallity very well. This comedy is upbeat, and though set in the fifties, it hasn't been affected by age at all. The theme itself is thousands of years old, (when the cat's away, the mice will play). My favorite scene is not the skirt blower however. It's right at the end when Marilyn is waving good-bye to Tom Ewell from the window. For a second you see why millions have fallen in love with her. The mixture of satisfaction and sadness on her face makes her perhaps the most beautiful woman who ever lived

"Don't last very long at all.......: I bought this to go with my cordless 20v Dewalt set of tools. This might not be so much the fault of the blade, as it is the fault of the reciprocating saw in the set. Since there is no adjustment for the blade guard, you will do all of your cutting at the same location on the blade, and wear it out faster than you would if you have an adjustable guard on the saw. If you have the same set of tools, or any recip saw that does now allow you to adjust the cutting location on the blade, then you will find that the blade wears out in the only location that you can cut with, and the rest of the blade is still perfect, but utterly useless.I have used other brands, with far better results, these are throw away blades, in my opinion.

"Suitable for afternoon soap opera: I found so many things about this book that made it totally unbelievable beginning with the character of Anna whose mind works more like a 30 year old than a teenager such as commenting on the name and price of cocktails. Not many lawyers are going to take a case without pay and spend this much time and become this emotionally involved. A mother who is also a lawyer isn't going to put herself in such a compromising position as Sara (and when did she find time to do all this -- legal work and mother of sick child). The coincidences just keep occurring: child advocate exlover of lawyer, son an arsonist with father a fireman, then father an EMT who rescues his daughter. And that ending was just too pat. In short, this is a good ""beach read"" but nothing of real substance here, and too bad because the subject is worth exploring

"A variety of music not on other CDs. Remastered with mediocrity.: Cuco Sanchez did not write all the songs here, but here is a variety of songs that do not always appear on other CDs. Sony has remastered this collection, and although it is not bad remastering, it is noticeable. By that I mean where the instruments are more profound out of the left and right speakers, hence the voice of Cuco is lower with more monotone sound.The favorites are Por Una Mjuer Casada written by Felipe Valdez Leal and Se Me Hizo Facil, a beautiful song written by Agustin Lara.This collection is not his most passionate, but still a wonderful collection of a fine musician. Some wonderful collections are:Cuco Sanchez, Su Voz, Su Inspiracion Y Sus Mejores Interpretes, Anillo De Compromiso - Fallaste Corazon - El Mil Amoreswith the guitar of Antonio Bribiesca, absolutely beautiful guitar accompaniment or solos.Tesoros de Coleccion

"lydon, cook, jones: I can't say this is the best rock and roll documentary ever made because I couldn't care less about the music of most other bands, let alone watch a happy little movie about how they became the celebrated, mediocre band they are. I can say this is a touching, hilarious, inspiring, fascinating film about some very young men, their music, their fashion and the social upheaval they caused just by saying what they believed.Julien Temple does a great job with the movie itself, giving the Pistols a strong sense of context for the American viewer, but his commentary on the DVD leaves something to be desired. Someone should have told him that this isn't an interview, but a chance for him to comment on the images in front of him.

"Enjoyable book: This story doesn't have so much to do with the first three Dollanganger books, as it's now 1997 (over a decade set after the actual date VCA published this, in the mid-80's) but still stands as a decent story in its own right, with the surprising reappearance of a character long thought dead. And religion comes back with this character, reminding Chris and Cathy all too well why they didn't want anything to do with religion. As a part of a series, Seeds of Yesterday doesn't contribute overmuch to the Foxworth saga, which is sad, because it'd have been nice to learn more about the Foxworths.Just one plothole - in SoY, it's 1997, but in the next book 'Garden of Shadows' (prequel to Flowers in the Attic), Olivia Foxworth's will included a letter to be opened 20 years after her death (which was the story of GoS) and her death was in 1972, so Chris and Cathy should have read GoS by now and already be aware of what happened between Malcolm and Olivia.

"profoundly weird, deliciously ironic: Most of the reviews here dont realize how absolutely CYNICAL this album is. Aside from being genius producers, FSOL is nothing if not intelligent. I dont find this album to be so much hippied out as a kind of sarcastic twist on the whole burnt out acid head mentality - sort of a musical equivalent of something very hunter s thompson-esque. The production is flawless, and as usual FSOL has not resorted to any sort of cheap tricks, just good musicianship. wow. Yes if you listen to this album the same way you'd listen to a later beatles album, its going to dissappoint; if you listen to it as a bizarre commentary on the 60's, its pure genius.

I can't imagine getting my hair this straight and smooth with any other product (and I've tried tons, believe me). I love how many heat options there are with the dial and the fact that you can use it on damp hair, without scorching it or not giving it enough heat.Be careful, though, because I just used it this morning and the power cord actually split right up by the swivel while it was plugged in. Huge sparks came out and for a second I thought it was going to catch fire. Now I have to order a new one, so just watch how much you wrap and unwrap the cord.

"Great Idea...Not so great product: Basically, this product is not built to last. I liked everything about this controller, except the fact that it is 6 months later and it doesn't work anymore. The left analog stick randomly sends signals to go to the right. So when I am trying to race in Need For Speed, I randomly get sent into the wall. :( The airflow idea works really well, it keeps your hands dry...but 6 months is not an acceptable lifetime for a controller.

"Not very fond of this bouncer: We received two different bouncers at my shower. I kept this one at our house because it matched his bedroom decor and looked cuter. I sent the different one to the babysitters. Big MISTAKE. My son hated this chair. The music is too slow and mellow, it made him tired to be in it. It was great if it was nap time. Now that I only work part time I got all my stuff back from the sitter, and he loves the other one. I think it the kick and play, it's bright yellow with red, green, blue, and purple lights. He absoutley LOVES it. He hits the toys, talks to it, kicks it, and wants to be in it. We use it to feed him now. I wish I would have known that in the first 4 months of my son's life. I could hacve had a little more free time. The fish really don't do anything to keep him intertained. All in all, it's great if your child is tired.

Always before, I emptied the box, scrubbed the sensors, and it worked again. At the end no amount of cleaning/clearing made any difference.

He said he had a great voice and really liked the songs he had heard on the radio. So I went to the POP/ROCK section of a local music/book store and found John Mayer. This CD was listed with most of his songs and was the most recent CD (2003). So I bought it and we were both COMPLETELY disgusted. There are NO VOCALS and it most certainly is NOT John Mayer. I believe the packaging had misrepresented the music inside, but was told by the Manager's Asst. that 'Our policy is to never take back opened merchandise.' I really felt that whoever created the CD cover for this Hillbilly version of John Mayer's songs did it knowing that customers would be confused and buy it because they thought it was John Mayer's actual work.

The songs I loved are there, but this cast doesn't begin to hold a candle to the ones I had seen live and David Hasselhoff is terrible. And the girl playing Lucy can't begin to hold a candle to Linda Eder, who I saw originally create the role. I could barely finish watching it.Don't waste your money. Instead buy the CD of the original cast and just imagine the visuals in your head.

"Long Lasting: I own two pair of MacNeil cordovans, one pair of black non-cordovan. I keep them polished, wear each once a week, seal the soles against winter water and salt, send them back to the factory for re-crafting when needed. They still look new after 20+ years. I had just polished one pair a few weeks ago, one of my co-workers asked me if I had new shoes! They are comfortable and always look nice. Highly recommended. BTW, all three pairs are seconds, bought at the local AE shoe store during one of their Sept sales.

"A Secretly Stupid Garden: This is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. The characters have the intelligence of worms and are about as interesting as one to.The story, unfortunatly, starts, at this huge old house. This bratty and selfish girl goes to life, after her parents died (probably couldn't stand her,...).There she meets this other annoying and bratty kid, who, if possible, may be more selfish than her. They eventually become friends, and discover this garden, that would have been better off stayed hidden, for the sake of the readers.And thats basically it. Beginning. Middle. End. Not even an interesting end. I could barely tell the difference between the beginning and the end. That may be a good thing.

"Delightful series from the BBC: Monarch of the Glen is a wonderful series from BBC. Endearing characters, beautiful setting, creative storylines focusing on family, friendships, loyalty, and love make this a delight to watch. The first 4 seasons are strong, but after some cast changes, seasons 5 and 6 are weaker, with no fault to the actors themselves. The writers attempted to ""replace"" some characters who had left but were generally unsuccessful; the one exception being Paul replacing Archie. However, season 7 wraps things up nicely, and once you're hooked, you really have to watch the entire series all the way through, no matter what. I couldn't help but think why more series such as this couldn't work on American television, the one exception being Northern Exposure. NEX fans will love this show. Watch and enjoy!

"LONG OVERDUE!: It took almost 20 years to bring the full series on DVD. Initially Universal licensed the first 10 episodes to VHS which I still keep in my video library but I found a person who had boot legged the whole series some 6 years ago and I bought the entire DVD set for 30 dollars. The person who boot legged my DVDs did a great job,but now I see they have the complete episodes released years later. Universal should have released these videos earlier. Maybe they thought the younger generation would not buy Black and White DVD. But I love Black and white-so appropriate for the horror genre. My favorites.""Pigeons From Hell"" and ""The Incredible Dr. Markesan"". Watch these sinister reels on Christmas Eve. This series has great ghosts stories as well. Boris Karloff is great as the host. To tell you the truth, that has always been one of my secret ambitions, to be the hostess of a horror or suspenseful television series.

"Utterly superlative: I rarely review books, however.... Mere words fail to describe the sheer genius that are the Mr. Hughart's efforts on Master Li and Number Ten Ox. The three books in this omnibus are so cleverly written, so unfailingly humorous and so totally poignant that other works will hereafter be spoiled for me. The author does state that he could have written more adventures for these characters after these three, but that they would have been formulaic, and what would be the point in that? As accurate as that may be, I mourn the fact that the world has no more to look forward to from this amazing author and his two phenomenal characters. Should he write anything else, I will snap it up. I also know that I will re-read these books in the future and approach that task with absolute glee, that I am given the chance to do so.

"These are too shrinky-dinky to count as real wine glasses: Read the dimensions carefully on this one because the picture makes them look like real wine glasses. They're not! They're tiny little taster glasses that can't hold a proper 5 ounce pour without being too full to benefit from the fancy shape (too little head space for proper bouquet or slosh-free swirling).If you just want cute little wine glasses you can get them much cheaper and they'll work just as poorly. If you want proper wine glasses to do all that sniffing and swirling you need ones that are much bigger.Yeah, this is the same review I put for the red ones, I bought both at the same time without looking carefully at the dimensions because they looked normal (shape-wise yes, size-wise no).

Well let me tell you this ""jumbling tower"" is just a piece crap. The reasons why have already been brought up. First and foremost is the size of the blocks. I'm sure that Jenga is patented and thats why this chinese knockoff uses blocks that are not the right size. According to the instructions you are supposed to rebuild the tower by hand, equally spacing every other row of blocks so that it creates a layer equal size of the last. I dont know about you but i dont want to spend 10 minutes to rebuild this tower. With jenga you just plop the blocks down in the little holder and stand it up with minimal fuss.The storage tin in a nice touch vs a cardboard box but believe me that is the only thing this has going for it.

Not a keeper, but, an OK read. I must say that practically no other romance writer can maintain sexual tension between the h/h like Ms. Cresswell aka Jasmine Craig does, which helps raise this story up a bit. She really has a talent for writing wonderful heroes, but her heroine's motivations in this instance needed work.

"Remembering England: I visited England a couple times, a few years ago. I bought several of the flake bars at that time and I don't think they even made it home to the US. I think they are flaky and wonderful. You do have to be a little prepared for the flakiness or you will lose some of your tasty chocolate candy. A local store (World Market) carried some Cadbury, but not these Flake Bars. In England, they were really cheap at that time, about 28 pence if I recall. To buy them here, it is much more of a commitment, but well worth it. I enjoyed them so much.

Thirdly, he uses a wide border from text to page, so that I have to yank and pull and stretch the book wide open in order to see the text towards the binding. It's nuts! Now the irony here is that the author goes to great lengths in the book to explain the mathematical and musical formulas for page layout! My point is, the book is hard to read!

Two venerable stars go out with a blaze of glory in this tale about the end of an era. Both in terms of time and setting of the film and also the end of Hollywood turning out westerns as standard movie fare. And as to the latter, I am sincerely regretfull. You have adequate folks laying out the story line here, suffice it to say it's about two old friends who have a falling out over a gold shipment they're transporting and their commitment to get it to the rightful owner, complicated by the marriage gone wrong of a young lady that joins them along the way.

"Senn E835 - muddy, congested mic: There are 4 mics to consider in the $100 price category: Sennheiser e835, Shure SM58, Audix OM-2, and AKG D5. I've been doing sound for 10 years. Each has its own faults.Senn: lower midrange congestion -- like you have a cold, warm-sounding, rolled-off highs. Very muddy sounding, but will add more ""body"" to your sound.Shure: cold-sounding mic, highs better than Senns, some mid-range muddiness.AKG: overall nice sounding mic. Problem when you ""push"" the mic, i.e. sing loud. Mic feels like it has a delay in it.Audix: very nice sounding mic. No major sonic problems. Nice, extended highs. It's the shadow of the awesome OM-5 ($250+) which is faster and has even better clarity.My advice: go with the Audix OM-2, or spend $200+ for an Audix OM-5 or Senn 935. Both high-end mics sound very similar.

"Not Complete without the Closed Captioning or Subtitles: I am a huge fan of Xena and was very disappointed that this DVD series haven't been encoded with Closed Captioning nor offered English subtitles. The majority of new media releases contain these features and the television even aired it with Closed Captioning as well as the finale DVD, so why would they exclude that in the season series? The pictures are great, but since I'm hard of hearing I need the story line to go with the pictures in order to fully experience Xena/Gabrielle, their adventures and spiritual growth. I will be holding off from buying any future Xena Season DVDs until someone produces them with CC or Subtitle features.

"The most important book on education of the past 20 years.: As a teacher with advanced degrees in reading and learning disabilities, I have never read a more concise, persuasive (and useful) book. Ms. McGuinness's research results certainly changed my professional direction. I bought Reading Reflex as well, became a certified Phono-Graphix instructor/trainer, and have built a successful reading therapy practice. EVERY client has succeeded using this approach (average: 24 session-hours). The sad part is the non-believers and the naysayers, those teachers and administrators who refuse to acknowledge the power of the evidence, refuse to read about this paradigm shift in instruction, and refuse to discuss the new possibilities for struggling readers of any age. Some even attempt to deny the obvious results! All I can say is I consult my copy of this book so often that it's falling apart--and I've just ordered a second copy from Amazon!

"Jury's still out: Jury's still out on this one. I do ballet. I sprained my knee and tore some ligaments in August. Neoprene knee braces are really thick and cumbersome. Plus, they restrict and constrict in all the wrong places at all the wrong times. The kinesiotape worked really well, BUT I developed a rash from the adhesive. I would still recommend using it. You have to have someone experienced and trained, to show you how to apply it correctly, though.

"Freddy and Jason kill the CRITICS: This movie is by far the most entertaining movie of 2003. I mean if you are into comical horror this is your movie to own. Although many crtics down it, it remained number one in the box office for weeks on in. Freddy is back and is funny and hysterical as ever, and the fan favorite Jason entertain's with his wit's and silentness. The late John Ritters son (Jason Ritter), makes his film debut as well as the multi-platinum recording artist from the R&B group Destiny's Child (Kelly Rowland). It's a good film to experience, especially for people with a sense of humor.

"Not worth the money: Printer soaked up ink like a sponge!! Ink cartridge became blocked even when stored with the original tape over the printhead. Lexmark technical support suggested using a damp lint free cloth to clear the printhead. This did not work most of the time. I was not too happy having to sponge bath the ink cartridge everytime I needed to print. After much complaining Lexmark sent out a replacement cartridge which eventually clogged after printing about 20 sheets of paper. Recommend buying some other brand of printer. Lexmark ink cartridges are expensive. The cost of these and the frequent problems makes this printer not worth buying. I went back to using HP printers. I have an 8 year old HP Laserjet 4ML that works like brand new after print over 4000 pages. I have an HP Photosmart 7550 for photo and color printing. I am very happy with both printers.

"Frightening study of people who care only about themselves.: Though I had read news accounts of Sante Kimes and her son's criminal exploits, this well written book tells how they became that way--i.e., people who'll do anything to get what they want--including killing apparently. More amazing to me is that they didn't need to enslave young women or steal fur coats because they were wealthy themselves. It seems they have personalities that can't be satisfied. You wouldn't want to meet this crime couple even on a bright sunny day. Smooth operators driven to satisfy themselves at everyone else's expense. It'll be interesting to see how many of the murders that they will have to face trial on. I hope the judges know to never let these people out to prey on others again.

"Great Album!!!: I don't understand much Spanish, but Martin's voice is absolutely wonderful here! The ballads are VERY romantic and the ""pop"" style songs are very upbeat without being clubby.I've listened to more than a few Latin artists (Sin Bandera included), and a lot of them are good at 1 or 2 styles of songs, but there's something about how Martin comes across on both ballads and the ""pop"" style songs. You can hear the feeling in his voice! I seriously can't say there's a bad song here!Interestingly enough, when I heard the Spanish/English version of Jaleo it really sounds awkward. The words don't seem to mesh as well as when he sings it all in Spanish.I have Martin's english albums and I like some of the songs on them, but he seems to put more feeling into his Spanish songs, and it comes across.I've ordered the rest of his Spanish albums, and can only guess how good they'll be! Ok, now I've got to learn more Spanish!

"Flawed production: There are some great aspects to this production: the orchestra, Domingo's voice and that of Pons. Zampieri's singing is bad, though. I wonder why they gave her the role. Also the supporting members of the cast, while doing some great singing, are poor actors, and their stage movements are usually awkward.While the Royal Opera House DVD with Domingo and Neblett is pretty good, the great news is that the memorable production by Metropolitan Opera with Barbara Daniels and (yes) Domingo is now available on DVD. It is terrific.

"No love for the fans: I am a big fan of Trisha's music so I bought this CD the first week it came out. I played it once or twice but it just didn't click with me the way her others did. Of course now that she is married to Garth Brooks she has to employ the same marketing gimmicks that he does to get people to buy the same CD more than once. It really irritates me when artists do not take their fans into consideration and add a song to a CD after hundreds of thousands of people have already bought the CD. It's not like you can just buy the one song on iTunes because it's not available. This will most likely be the last CD I ever buy from her. I stopped buying Garth Brooks' music after he re-released every CD he'd ever recorded with a new song on it or with new cover artwork. Enough is enough... artists need to stop making their money off the backs of the working people who need to buy the same CD's multiple times to get the songs they hear on the radio.

The wealth of information is impressive, down to extensive lists of accommodation, including many budget options, dining, nightlife and public transportation. The guidebook includes a comprehensive description of attractions across the country that are not even mentioned in similar guidebooks. A true gem.

"total misinformation: The author bases his ""facts"" on outdated myths and urban legends rather than on anything real about any of the groups covered. The chapter on TOPY is one large mistake from start to finish, obviously using information gathered completly from mid-1980's tabloids. This books reads much more like a Christian propaganda tract than as a real guide for understanding anything.Not only does this book insult the groups it is supposed to be about, but it also does an injustice to police officers who are truly interested in learning about these practices and to how best to deal with a situation where encountering them. Anyone looking to learn the truth about any of these groups or practices in an unbiased fashion would be well advised to look elsewhere.

I also hope that it will work in Europe, too, as I plan to use it there next month. The price is very good and I like that I can use it without having to be in any particular network. I got the cell phone in just a few days, in very good condition (it was well wrapped in the box).The only problem I had was when I had to charge the battery twice before actually using it because after the first time, it kept disconnecting the call after first minute of talking. Checking the internet, I discovered that the problem may resolve if the battery was taken out and after putting it back, recharge the battery.Overall, I give it 4 stars as it is really good for this type of phone.

"Disappointing...: I read the reviews for this item and needed something new so I thought I'd give the i vibe a test drive. So, I purchased the toy and was very excited to try it out. There are so many problems with this toy. While the internal rotations and vibrations are fun, the item still needs more power, a LOT more power. Not to mention if you want the proper external stimulation you have to angle and hold the internal element perfectly to maintain the needed friction. Finally, the biggest disaster. While you can control internal and external speed separately, that is not so with the motion control. So, you cannot have steady vibe externally and a swirly vibe internally. Do NOT buy this product unless you are new to toys or it doesn't take more than a feather's touch for you to reach climax.

"Waste of time and money: This book is a superficial (at best) review of the Java classes needed to build Java GUI's. It does cover some AWT concepts in the first 100 pages, and very briefly covers a few key Swing concepts.Most of the book is one (sometimes 2 or so) pages briefly describing each GUI control with a simplistic code example (with errors). You could get just as much information from reading the Javadocs!I'm an experienced Java programmer and originally purchased this book some time ago in hopes that it would cover GUI topics in depth. I was very disappointed in the depth of material. I would not even recommend this book for beginners because you can get just as much information readin the docs or from other sources.

"Pair of hiss-making machines: When Amazon.com sent me these headphones, I discovered that they are not headphones but actually a machine for making white noise. They do play some sound, but they also take whatever hiss there was on the audio track, and they amplify it drastically. Not only that, but the hiss amplification is strangely correlated with the pitch of the sound. Imagine a movie character talking - with natural variations in voice pitch, the hiss would increase or decrease, thus creating a whole new hiss track to the movie. Do not purchase these flawed headphones/hissing device.

"Safe Reliable comfortable heat: Ever since buying my EdedPURE heater I couldn't dream of going back to using my natural gas flame throwing furnace. It is the most comfortable heat I have ever had in my home and heats so evenly. Yes it does raise the electric bill, but with NO gas bill now the savings for heating my house is nearly half the cost. I don't even think the money savings is the best part of these heaters, its the comfort you feel from the soft warm heat that is worth having a infrared heater in your home. And now I don't have to crack windows (as all yes ALL gas furnaces leak some fumes and CO into your home) so to balance fresh air I always left a window cracked when using the gas fired furnace. I love the fact EdenPURE and other infrared heaters don't emit fumes and don't dry the air like the gas furnace did. It is a great product on my 3rd year using it and just love it.

"This is a confusing read: This version of Think and Grow Rich is a major disappointment. The beauty of Napoleon Hill's original book is that it is seamless -- you almost can't wait to get to the next page, the next idea. But in this book the editors stick in huge sections of italicized material every few pages that have little or nothing to do with Hill's ideas at that point in the text. It's almost as if he is constantly being interrupted. All that italics material just gets in the way when you're trying to absorb Hill's ideas, which are themselves wonderful. I am not certain what the editors were trying to do here, but they completely succeeded in messing up a great book, which I have read perhaps fifteen times.

"Wicked boring.....painfully so.: This is the first DL book I've actively debated not finishing. This book made the Jean Rabe books seem great by comparison to this monotonous tub of dung.The beginning was slow and written with an excruciating level of detail, internal monologue, and bouncing around from past present and future in reference to Galen being a little brat and getting around punishments for his behavior.After the first few chapters the bouncing around was ditched...thank God, but the monotony of detail and internal conversations continued or even increased.I suffered through this until page 160 or so last night. I'm considering skipping the rest of this book or at least just jumping to the end to have closure on this crap I've read so far (something I've never done before with a book, especially a DL book!).

"Mediocre Thriller: This was the second book I read by Richard Hoyt and it just confirmed my impression of him as a rather mediocre hack author of Cold War spy thrillers. Where ""Trotsky's Run"" featured an American politician and KGB sleeper agent who thought he was the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky, ""The Manna Enzyme"" starred Fidel Castro himself. Unfortunately, the amusing premise of a middle-aged, overweight and clean shaven (!) Fidel going on a covert operation in the rural byways of Ronald Reagan's America is wasted in a standard-issue, Cold War, anti-left plot. Hoyt's grip on politics is pretty pedestrian and, if memory serves, he seemed much more interested in Castro's youthful tryout with the New York Yankees.I was smiling writing the description above, but in remembering the actual experience of reading the book, I just honestly can't recommend it, no matter whether you're a leftist like me or a rock-ribbed, free-marketeer capitalist. It's just not that good a read.

They are not the best garage band to ever cross the music scene, but they do capture some of that essence in their diversity of songs, not all of which are grungey. I particularly love the guitar riff in the middle of 'Homesick'. It's just a tale of yearning in itself.

"Not Impressed: I am a long time fan of the back seam. And I have many expensive brands, but I thought that I would try a slightly cheaper one and compromise just a little on quality. Well, I compromised a lot. The first pait I put on prompty began to run, and it was from the seam of the foot! So it was not a operator error, but manufactorer issue. I won't buy them again just to avoid the loss. Even if it was just a few bucks.

"Disappointing: I have to agree with most of the negative comments posted here. I took several courses in calculus in college but wanted to relearn it quickly. Instead of dragging out my old texts, I bought of copy of this book. Big mistake. The volume is written for mathematicians. There are few practice problems, and the ones that are included do not have solutions! The chapter exams consist of extremely difficult problems, making the use of this text discouraging. I ended up buying Calculus for Dummies and using my old texts to get problem sets.I would add that I also bought the 'Demystified' volumes on linear algebra and differential equations, and both of them were quite good. The calculus volume seems to be a dud, though.

"Exaggeration even in the Book's introduction: In the introduction you write your 'infant son was living proof of your zina (sex out of wedlock)'? how was it living proof? did you declare that to the Saudi authorities in your Hajj visa application? or did you say that the Saudi immigration? All that a infant travelling alone with you showed was that either you were divorced or had permission from your husband to travel alone as required by Saudi authorities. It would seem you are trying to exaggerate some perceived threat to your person in order to dramatize this book in order to sell your book.

On the third day it feels very strange when I'm using it, as if it's not really brushing my teeth. I came to check if other buyers have this problem, and I saw some have the suspicion that they are fake brushheads. One reviewer suggests to check this picture with my brushheads, and yes, they look different! The ""Oral B"" is grey on the ones I just purchased, and the blue part of the brushhead is darker!!

"Not much of a maintenance manual: I ordered this book based upon others' reviews. What you get with this book is a pretty good history of Ford Trucks, but when it comes to maint.issues, it barely skims the surface, then when it does begin to get deep into it, it usually says something to the effect of ""see your Ford maintenance manual"". Well, I thought that's what I was buying, a maintenance manual, but it's not. If you want a history book, go for it. If you want a maintenace manual, buy the Haynes manual.

"A Beautiful, Powerful Book: This is a must-read for everyone interested in healthcare, healing, mental health and/or Lakota culture and spirituality. It's a biography of the late Joseph Eagle Elk, which is riveting and remarkable. And as an extra bonus, the last chapter consists of a lively, multicultural discourse on the spiritual aspects of health and healing. I wish it were required reading for all healthcare professionals in the U.S.! As a Lakota, I found the book accurate and very moving. It's also one of the few books about Indigenous Tribal People written by a European-American that is truly and deeply respectful. The author conveys the complexity of Lakota culture without being patronizing or pseudo-mystical. Thank you, Mr. Mohatt, for this beautiful book.

"Fitline 140 mat: When I purchased this, it wasn't obvious that it is the Fitline 140. I decided to take a chance and purchase it anyway. I'm so glad I did, b/c it IS the Airex Fitline 140. I paid $45 for it. I'm not sure what it'll be listed for at the time you're considering this purchase. hopefully the same or less.Anyway, my physical therapist had recommended the Airex brand, saying that it's one of the best.I am not using it as a yoga mat. I use it as an exercise mat.I like that it's cushy b/c I want to be as comfortable as possible when I'm doing sit-ups, but it kinda smells of sweat which is gross.

"Worked perfect at first, then I get every error msg it has.: I got this from Best Buy a couple of months ago, installed it, and burned cds with perfect speed and perfect quality. All was fine through the first 30 or so cds, but after that I started getting weird error messages in Nero (the one I always used with it). So, I contacted Nero tech support and asked them what the problem could be, took a week and a half to get a response, and finally they ask me if my system meets all the requirements. Here's the kicker: I gave them the system requirements for the CD Burner, my system specs, and how I had the burner set up. So after that I contacted I/O magic's tech support, and I still haven't gotten a response after a week. So this thing is coming out of my computer and going back to the store. If you're thinking of buying this, I recommend making paper airplanes with your money instead. They're alot cheaper than the cds I had to buy, only for them to be turned into coasters.

"Where's my ice pack? I have a headache: Spoof movies will either sink or swim with audiences. There is a fine line between stupid and good comedic genius. This movie, however, fell into the first catagory. Then again, I knew that when I got it for the evening, so I wasn't completely disappointed.Combining a cast from other spoof / comedy movies and a WHOLE lot of other recent blockbuster hits (Chronicals of Narnia, Willy Wonka, X Men, etc.), four orphans are brought together to have an adventure in Narnia combining all the aspects of before named movies. It is too busy, has too many ridiculous premises, and just plain bad.Some good words for this movie? Crispin Glover as Willy Wonka. He was actually a better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp was, even though he was only in the movie for five minutes. Otherwise, skip this one.

She does not explain the exercise before starting the routine, so that by the time you watch her do the workout and then start to do it with her, she is off to another exercise. The routines are short and require room, lots of room -- more than most living rooms offer, even with removing furniture.The exercises are more acrobatic than required and not typical of her other workouts. If you fear knocking out your back or hurting yourself, this workout is not for you. If you are young, physically fit and lithe, you might enjoy it. I didn't.

"Many Perspectives on Practicing Buddhist Meditation: This book is a collection of writings by various authors in Buddhism and meditation grouped into four sections: translations of original Pali source teachings, teachings of some classical masters, teachings of some contemporary masters, and personal reports of practicing meditation from five individuals.I found the papers written by the contemporary masters to contain some useful insights and instruction on Buddhist teachings and of meditative practices.The personal accounts were most informative. Here the writers reveal their personal struggles and successes with meditation. Such personal accounts are apparently rare in that those learning meditation are encouraged not to discuss their experiences.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more about the practice of Buddhist meditation.

"A love story with a twist. The ULTIMATE Obsession..........: Quite possibly one of the most ambitious and alternative love stories ever. Combining all the essential ingrediants that go to make a great Sci-Fi stew, this has action and adventure, cemented together against a romantic plot.When Eric Abbott glimpses the girl through the window of a passing car, he knows nothing will stop him from meeting her. He soon learns that other people feel differently about this, and will do anything to keep them apart. Anything.As he quest to meet the woman of his dream intensifies, Abbott discovers abilities he never knew he had, and his love for the mystery woman could prove to be not only his own undoing, but all of mankinds.Quite possibly one of the best example of the genre, you have to read The I Inside. From cover to cover it's a rollercoaster ride you won't want to get off!

"Typical Liberal Propaganda: I was very disappointed in this movie....it turned out to be a polemic of being very anti-big business and pro-environmentalism....typical liberal propaganda at its best. We need cotton to make our clothes. We grow the cotton, pick it and turn it into clothes, and then the Cotton grows back and the process starts all over again, but not in this world apparently. The trees once they're processed die off for whatever reason. Again, typical liberal propaganda. Aside from the 3d modeling, I have nothing to recommend for this movie. Im just sorry for all the schoolchildren who are no doubt going to grow up brainwashed with this piece of tripe.

"The least informative book about Sindh: I disliked this book. The author travels to Sindh and revists the places visited by Sir Richard F. Burton, and then writes about his observations. I have 2 problems with this book..One is that the authors obsession with prostitution and homosexuality distorts his views of this great land. Secondly, his views are clouded by his sources which are all feudal in nature. One cannot experience Sindh without looking at the lives of the everyday people. I for one wasn't impressed by the fact that the authors hosts in Sindh were the biggest criminals and landlords of the province.Finally, it is silly for the author to keep pointing out that Burton was well known for his controversial report about homosexuality in Karachii. We got that the first time he mentions it.

However, as they are in and out of the pool three or five times daily, I wanted to trim the hair down a bit. I normally do this by hand and it always looks a little choppy. No more!! This tool is fabulous! You simply comb it through and it takes the excess off. You may need a different sized one depending on the silkiness of the dog's coat. Two of mine are great with the extra fine, but for my one boy who has super silky hair and lots of curls, that size doesn't do a nice job. I had to buy the one with fewer teeth for his coat. It takes out the undercoat with ease and the dogs simply love it too. After they're done, they prance around very happy to be cooler and still handsome!

"A Slow Start: 'A is for Alibi is a shallow beginning to a very enjoyable mystery series. In the first of the Kinsey Millhone mysteries Grafton introduces her female detective through an investigation of a murder case closed eight years before. While the plot is interesting, the brevity of the novel leaves the narrative feeling underdeveloped. The characters are intriguing, but the ease with which Millhone forms relationships with other characters is grossly unbelievable, creating the sensation that the reader has walked in mid-story, missing a great deal of background. While 'A' is for Alibi is not terrible on its own, the Kinsey Millhone series is one that improves greatly as it progresses.

"Quiet Wisdom and Lyrical Beauty: Did you every really look at the New York Times Best Sellers List, the Nonfiction List? The 16 books on it are almost all always by celebrities, about celebrities, people or events in today's headlines, books that come and go in a flash. Books like Gardening in Eden by Arthur Vanderbilt will never make it onto the List. They don't stand a chance. And that's a shame, for in this small book I got for Christmas (its just 189 pages long) is so much quiet wisdom, such humor, such lyrical beauty and fine writing that I wish more people knew about it. In the simple setting of a garden the author finds the world and shares that exuberant joy on every page. I would highly recommend this book. My guess is that when today's current crop of bestsellers are forgotten, Gardening in Eden will still be a perennial classic.

In the illustrations, there is much for preschoolers to note and discuss (e.g., mom's frown as Jesse spills pudding).I appreciate the sentiment in many of the poems. In particular, the poem called ""Hurry, Jesse"" captures the interaction between a working parent and a preschool child perfectly, from the mother encouraging the child to hurry, to the child asking for more time to play, to the mom realizing that unhurried time for the child is probably more important that the task she is rushing off to complete.

Keith was a great addition to the Dead and Garcia Bands sound (until the last year, when he seemed asleep at the wheel most of the time). This is hardly the best to be found, of any of the parties involved. Save 5 stars for when they are deserved. They become meaningless when thrown around too often.

"BORING: I've just listened to all the amazon snippets after reading a positive review from Uncut. Fair enough I have not heard all of every song but what I did hear was basically the same song over and over except for the obligatory ballad. The guy is an awful singer and they sound like a good bar band at best. There are so many bands and singer songwriters who do this style of music who are 100% better than this mess

"Not-so-great Heavy Metal: These scissors are heavy, metal, and unbelievably dull. The workmanship that went into producing these scissors can best be described as mediocre. But it's the dullness of the blades that bothers me most. I've bought numerous pairs of scissors and shears through the years and these are the worst I've seen in a long time. If there was an attempt to sharpen these at the factory, it must have been fairly halfhearted one. I am disappointed. Maybe I'll like them better after I sharpen them.

"Pure Crap: This was the worst book I have ever read - completely tasteless and boring. In fact, I think the author even got bored writing in the end. Do not even waste your time reading this book. It is a complete waste of time. There is nothing to be learned or gained, not even any enjoyment whatsoever from reading the book. Pointless subplots having nothing to do with anything, a main character who does not learn anything in the end but spends a lot of time jerking off and getting away with raping a midget, and a ""white-trash"" setting and cast of characters that are only included in the story to give the book ""character"" is not good literature. I am so disgusted by how much crap gets published that I am writing a letter of protest to Random House. It's about time attention is spent in publishing quality literature.

"Too Slow, Too Dull, Too Boring: The King Must Die; Greek Mythology's Theseusis transformed into a 300 page bore by Mary Renault. I am a fairy smart 9th grader who reads at a very advanced level. However, no matter how hard I tried, I could not understand anything this book talked about. It would drag on about how he is so-and-so's kid for pages, and then introduce new characters no one has ever heard of, throw in a battle or two, and boom--one page later, it talks about being so-and-so's son again. If you want my advice, read this book if you have to for school(like me) or if you are very bright, able to remember all of the characters, like greek mythology, and have a few months to waste.

"Getting there: Decent indie-pop driven by steady drum beats, catchy guitar riffs, and the occasional well placed keyboard. Although most songs are mediocre at worst, there are a few gems that outshine the rest and make it worth a few listens. They sound A LOT like Beulah (point in case: track 7, Situation). You can definitely hear the potential, perhaps their next album will bring it all together.Recommended tracks:#7 Situation - Their first single, amazingly catchy drum beat and vocals. Very sing-a-longy.#4 Death in the Garden, Blood on the Flowers - The bass line makes this song what it is, along with the amazing clapping.#8 I Want to Love You in My Room - Another bass driven song, which is always good.#1 The Gentle Preservation of Children's Minds - A little slower than the other songs, but nonetheless good. Very catchy guitar riff.

"MUST READ: The book Hindenburg 1937 is a well written emotionaly effecting love story that takes place during the tramatizing time of WW2. The book is about a young German girl who is living with her grandfather. He dies with his hands on a pair of ticketts to board the Hindenburg in his hands. She is sure that this means she is to board the Hindenburg and leave Germany for America but her brother won't have it. So she escapes and boards. A girl unescorted and looked for is not safe. So she simply walks up to someone and says ""Hi, I've been looking all over for you"". Luckly it works and everything is going well until she sees her X-long time boyfriend on the ship who is now a nazie spy. And no matter how much he hurt her she still loves him. A love story, complicated mysterie, and more aries. I cannot even express how wonderfful this book is. WARNING: Be prepared to cry after I finished reading it I cried for and hour.

"A great subwoofer: We have a basic extensive system set up with a Yamaha HTR-5760 7.1 receiver, 2 x E90 towers, EC25 center channel, and a pair of E30 rear speakers. This sub is the perfect complement to anyone's component home audio system. It excells in music and movie experiences, and the variable crossover and volume is great to custom tune to each situation. I cannot think of a better sub for the price on the market. It truly carries a great smooth sound not found in smaller subwoofers, and is easily capable of pressurizing standard size rooms. I am extremely pleased with this product and recommend it to anyone who doesn't have the thousand to drop on the ones that the ""number driven"" stores try to sell. A must buy...

"Not impressed: If you're looking for a seat that baby can kick and play and have a good time this is NOT the seat for you! If you're looking for a seat for baby to sleep in this IS the seat for you. I was looking for a seat to keep baby occupied while I took a shower or cooked dinner and this one was terrible for that. My 6 week old couldn't get comfortable in the upright position and her head would slant way down if she even moved her body a little bit because the seat is too straight up and stiff. When its time to sleep she goes in her crib so I didn't even really use the bassinet part of it. Overall this chair is not practical for a playful happy and wiggly baby which most are! I ended up returning this for another and it was also much cheaper.

"Not for the dilettante.: I have rated this book four stars, not because I feel that it is well above average but not spectacular, as that would normally indicate, but because I do not feel qualified to rate it and wish to have as little effect on its average rating as possible. I am a reasonably intelligent, reasonably well-educated individual with a good facility for numbers. Still, this book was well over my head. If you're planning a career in Mathematics or Physics, this book is probably necessary to your education, but unless you're truly brilliant, don't be surprised if you need qualified instruction to understand it. But if you're simply an intelligent, curious individual with a desire to comprehend Einstein's theories, don't be surprised if you can't make hash of this book.

"Among the best Civil War era history books ever written.: Jim Bishop was a terrific newpaper columnist of the 50's and 60's who wrote the prize winning book, ""The Day Christ Died"" and followed it with this one during the Civil War Centennial. It is well worth this re-print edition. An absolutely relentless march of the men, women and events of the last 24 hours in the life of Lincoln. The detail here does not slow the history. Indeed it is the life blood of this enthralling book. Meticulous research brings the story to full color. You will feel the heartbeat of Booth as he approaches the President's box. You will suffer the shock of Mrs. Lincoln when she realizes her husband has been wounded. You will weep for Abraham Lincoln. Seldom is history as truely revealing as this.

"Good book, but far far from great: First, as the title of my review implies I *did* enjoy this book, and I *would* recommend this book.In a nutshell, it was a good story, put together well, well told, easily read with a good ending. Nothing wrong there, but that's as far as it takes the reader.To those of you going into this book expecting the next great american novel, or ""the best book you ever read"" as I have seen more than a few describe it in other reviews, um.. no. Not even close.I think all the reviews and even the critics reviews have done this otherwise very good book an injustice. You will not find wisdom in it's pages, nor will you laugh/cry/etc (at least I didn't).So, if you go into reading this book with the expectation of a good read, you won't be dissapointed. If your looking for something special, I just didn't find it in this book.In the end, my criticism isn't with this book, but all the incorrect accolades poured upon it.

"An Original Comic Noir Masterpiece: Pour yourself a martini, turn the lights down low, relax and drift away into a world of intrigue, murder, double crosses and passion. From the start this briskly written, intricately crafted audio movie takes hold and won't let go. It is a richly textured audio experience full of music, sound effects and a variety of colorful characters which allow the listener to clearly visualize the action and the drama as it unfolds. Full of humor, clever twists, colorful language and cool style this audio experience is best experienced in its entirety--and once you start listening you won't be able to stop! If you're a fan film noir, radio drama, or classic mysteries then you'll love Double or Nothing, don't miss it.

"THE BEST -- MY FEET ARE FINALLY WARM: I loved my battery operated warmers but they were costly, broke at least once a season, had to be replaced and cumbersome. Finally, an easy to use, inexpensive way to keep my feet from getting cold. I have poor circulation in my feet and have tried everythng from the battery insoles to taping hand warmers to my socks and using pepper rubs in plastic bags. As a scuba diver, I thought this just might work. And it did. My feet aren't what I would call toasty but they certainly are ""warm"" enough, they have feeling in them and I am comfortable all day which is what matters. And that is with one pair of medium ski socks. I am thrilled to have found these and even more so by the price and ease of use. I haven't tried them in below zero (F) but they did well in single digit temps that warmed to the teens.

"Awesome overnight diapers!: To be honest, when I first read the box (when my son was a newborn), I thought to myself, why would I ever keep my baby in one diaper for 12 hours (ewwwwww!) but the second he began sleeping through the night, I figured it out (hah!).These diapers are great and we have never had a morning blow outs, despite our son sleeping 12+ hours a night and definitely releasing a lot of substance into the diaper during that time. Moreover, he tends to roll several times at night and gets up and plays actively in his crib for a while (before we realize he is up) and even so, with all the movement, bouncing and a full diaper, there haven't been any leaks.We've put him in other diapers overnight and he's blown through all of those.

"Sweet story...very touching!!!: This was definitely a quick read and also very different. I think Patterson had a way of telling this story through the diary, and yet switching back and forth between Katie and Suzanne to get his point across. I also think perhaps this story touched on his own life and it was written with heart. My thoughts anyway. Deep love is such a wonderful thing to get and have for however long we're lucky enough to have it. You could see that Matt wasn't ready for another relationship, so he walked away. But he loved Katie, so he wanted her to know ""why"" and he left her the diary. I'm putty in a writer's hands when it comes to romance, and I thought this story was a sweet one. I do think Patterson is a better mystery writer, but I'd admire his efforts on this one. I have one more book of Patterson's to read and then I'm moving on to someone else. I don't think this book was boring, but it wasn't your super-duper romance. It was just what it was...""sweet"".

"ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE HAS RISEN: I am sixteen years old, and I have been reading the Tarot for three years. This deck is very special, and you can feel it the first time you hold it.I can honestly say this is a very attractive deck. Each card is beautifully illustrated and acts as a doorway to the untapped potential of the Tarot.The book that comes along with the deck is very informative, and gives a few lessons on candle magick, and how to tap into the vast knowledge of these astral enigmas that are thought of by many as fairy tale creatures. It includes step by step instructions, candle color properties, and a list of stones to add a bit more ""magick"" to the spells and readings. It deserves five stars.I strongly believe that you shouldn't order decks. Search for your own special and personal deck. Try to feel for it, and it will call and draw you in. This is just something that I believe everyone that wants a Tarot deck should know. Thanks for reading.

That laughable statement sealed this books fate for me, renaming a system folder would have catastrophic results on any Operating System and making it sound like Linux would not is absolute drivel!BYW, as a whole this book is pretty poor.

"Okay if you're a techno-wizard...: I bought my Toshiba several years ago, avenging never to pay a subscription fee to the likes of DirecTV and Tivo. It was always a very difficult box to program, even with the TVGuide feature. When all broadcasters moved over from analog to digital, the signal stopped completely. Since then, I use an APP on my iPhone to find the time of shows I like, then manually program the information into the box. VERY convoluted, but it does work... unless (as is this time of year) broadcasters rearrange the lineup each week.Not overall pleased with the device; I am the only one in the household who can navigate all the screens to get things programmed, but it DOES save us subscription fees, I probably would never have bought this had I known how bad it was to program.

I am not sure how historically accurate it is, but I AM sure that it is entertaining. Seduction, innocence, dark secrets, chastity, evilness and even incest all in one book.

"Mallory usually makes a good product, but not this one.: Was advertised as 300 ohm per foot cable when in fact actually 6-7 thousand ohm rated. The better 937 cable is 300 ohm per ft. My used, wornout wires measured about 6400 ohms per ft. Otherwise product ok.

"Great Qi Healing video!: Lisa B O'Shea is a knowledgeable and inspiring teacher in person. This DVD totally captures that same energy. She really demystifies Qi Healing and gives you plenty of useful tools you can use right away. You learn how to scan yourself or someone else, feel a blockage and actually pull it out of the body. Then she teaches you safe ways to put energy back in. She talks a lot about the nature of qi/energy in ways you can really understand. I think Lisa B O'Shea's clear and straightforward approach to this dense topic of ""Qi Healing"" makes it a wonderful ""How To"" DVD for anyone at any level of experience.

"Kindle2 disadvantages: The kindle 2 has no page numbers so you can follow your reading, It has spaces in the text where a letter or word should be thus disrupting your reading. the dictionary defines a word (sometimes) with the word itself. That cannot happen. There may or maynot be an index, bibliography, etc. at the end of the book. the captions underneath the pictures, maps, charts, graphs, etc. have very tiny printing and thus a very large magnifying glass is required to read underneath. Most times one cannot read it. You cannot enhance the image whatsoever, There is no light to read in the background at night. The leather case is essential and needed for the Kindle 2. The bookmarks appear to be useless.

"Terrible film: McLintock was such a disappointing film. I watched the film because I thought it would be a great John Wayne western, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot is developed into something that could be good, but it never gets there. If you are looking for a classic western, this is not it. There is really none of the action one comes to expect in the John Wayne movies. The most fighting is a mildly humorous fight in a mudpit and Wayne chasing his wife through town. It could have been good, but it is not. There is a reason this film is in the public domain and free on Youtube. I would never watch this film again. It is a waste of the two hours that you spend viewing it.

"Sweet Book: Its been a long while since I was in high school and this story really took me back to those times. It wasn't a very long book, but it still took the time to let Ivy and Zak to get to know each other. It was a story about growing feelings between two kids in high school, but it didn't talk down to the reader. There could have been more time for character development, but the guts of the story - the heart of the story - was very sweet. I'm a big fan of interracial romances with BW/WM and I recommend this one.

"Great starter chopsticks for kids!: I purchased these four our 16-month old twin boys and they work great to teach them how to use chopsticks. On first use, picking up miniture marshmellows, they both immediately got the hang of using chopsticks. Next day, using them with breakfast, one of the twins already uses them unassisted and the other needs only a little help getting them into position. They are a bit big for their hands but not too big. The twins do not hold them exactly right yet but they understand squeezing them to pick up things (but are still learning to unsqueeze in their mouth instead of in front of it).If you are going to teach kids to use chopsticks, these would be a great, and inexpensive first set.

I don't know how anyone can take a book seriously from a man who kissed DiMaggio's behind the past 16 years simply to make money off of him.

Those who revered DiMaggio may have a hard time reading Cramer's book because it reveals the Yankee great for who and what he really was.

"May make you re-think your next judgment of a person...: This novel is a page turner. I simply could not put it down, and read it all in one day. The story of an old lady with many stories to her life and a little girl with terrible stories of her own. You will want only the best for Addy and Sharla- and burn with the need for justice when the best doesn't always happen. Lori Lansens is a wonderful story teller, I found myself compelled to keep going to find out what would happen next, and sad when I awoke this morning to realize that I had already finished the book and the story was over. It is written in a rather spare style, which makes the events even more poignant. It is non-sentimental, and Addy Shadd is one of the best heroines I had recently read. Five stars is the least award I would give this wonderful book.

The snow was wet and heavy, and I was never more thankful to just push the snow. That is the real beauty of this item. You don't pick up the snow you just push it out of the way, and when the snow at the edge starts to get high you just tilt the blade up and push the blade right over the high snow. It does have a small learning curve, but it is easy to use. I would recommend it to anybody. I am not sure that I went any faster, but I can tell you I felt a thousand times better afterwords than with my traditional shovel.

It had an okay section on actual movement, defense, and punches, but seemed to focus on his white collar friends. He even used them as models, and refers to them in text.

TO say this wouldn't happen to me would be total denial on my part. I wept, I laughed. I had to put the book down on numerous occations just to regroup.

After enjoying the first 2 Spider-Man, people have great expectation of the latest story, especially Spider-Man's arch-villain Venom is in it.The problem with Spiderman 3 is the director trying to jam too much into the movie. Too many characters, too little time, and it ends up that non of the characters has enough development into them. Viewers can't not relate to their pain or why they they fight. The end fight is pretty much meaningless after learning the story of Sandman at the end; people would wonder why Sandman even bother to setup the end fight with Spidy at first.

"An Enjoyable Look Back at the Dawn of the Jet Age: Skyliners takes us across North America, from sea to shining sea, and presents the dawn of the Jet Age in all its glory. Each stop offers an amazing variety of late piston and turboprop and early jet passenger aircraft, ranging from the familiar Boeing 707 and DC-8 to more obscure birds. Those of us who had the good fortune to have witnessed this interesting era in civil aviation will remember with great fondness those United Jet Mailiners, Eastern Golden Falcon Jets, and Delta and American Airlines Flagships and Astrojets.The photos are generally of good quality and well reproduced. The short captions are entertaining, even if they do not have a great deal of substance. What makes this book worth the money is that it offers a seldom seen glimpse to the late 1950s and early 1960s, one rarely seen in such a high-quality format.

"New Queen of Suspense??: Well part 3 to this series was just as awesome as part one. I think it is better than part 2. The only problem I have with any of the books in this series is that I feel I was tricked into reading them. Part one and 2 were kindle freebies then you had to buy part 3 and 4. I will be honest I buy very few books for my kindle because of the price hike that occured right after I purchased my kindle. I would say this is a great series of books and mild enough for teh wholel to read them.

"The Captive Audience: Jedi Apprentice #7, the Captive Temple, is just as endearing,captivating,fascinating and frustrating as the other six. Incredibly well written, and not just for a childrens book, this one is filled with non-stop action from the first page to the last, with lightsaber action sequences that will leave you breathless. We begin to see an aspect of Qui-Gons personality emerge-his devotion and affection for the underdog, who just happens to be Obi-Wan in this case. This book holds true to all its predecessors in that it leaves you wanting more.

"The beginning of the end: Superficial, trite...just an all around bummer. Who cares about Beverly Hills? Who would ever buy into the ridiculous dialouge that is the supposed ""voice"" of this show about nothing? What a mess! What an afront to young people living during this awful time! For anyone even remotely interested in the 90's, lemme tell ya...they sucked completely. Fashion was asinine and except for a few small pockets of music, that sucked as well. Everything ""hip"" and ""cool"" was being bought up by big business who were running over themselves to cash in on ""youth culture"" at a sickening and alarming rate. It was a horrorfying time to be alive, only to be outdone by the oughts (00's). Pathetic, cruel, and no redeeming value whatsoever. Buy something like ""Alice's Restaurant"" instead. At least then you'll get something genuine and meaningful.

"Disappointed: Purchased two of these in December 09, one for the road bike and one for the mountain bike. Installed one on the mountain bike, setup the device for the appropriate wheel size, took it out for a spin - wild differences between it and the GPS I carried. Speed was sometimes three times more than the GPS unit, other times it was close, but more often wildly higher than the GPS. Going up a 15% grade it read I was traveling 9mph when the GPS read 3.9mph. At first thought it might be the front shocks possibly causing the problem, locked them out, still the same problem. Re-calibrated the unit by using the wheel length method, same problem existed. Transferred the unit to the road bike, same situation with the wild readings. Both units are going back to Amazon for a refund. Wish they worked, as I prefer not to have wires hanging and strapped to either bike. Will stick with the GPS unit solely until I find a reliable product.

"It's really not that bad!: If you're looking for an in-depth intructional video, this is not it. Nor is it a high-impact cardio workout. I'd say that it's more for muscular tone & endurance (my arms were BURNING by the time the warmup was over!), and it's also pretty relaxing. The camera work was pretty bad, but not quite as abysmal as it's been made out to be. When you can't see the appropriate body part, it's often during repetitions of a move she's already shown you - if you have any kind of dance experience at all, it shouldn't throw you *too* much.As I said, if you want detailed instruction in proper belly dance technique, this is not the video for you.

"Just one caution: I agree with others who have offered high praise for this resource.I've been out of the OT field for over 20 years and passed the NBCOT exam first time; I don't think I would have done it without this book.Just one caution: The format of the NBCOT exam has changed since this book was published. It is not entirely different, but as of this year, it includes ""simulation"" questions that are extended case studies. This book will not help you prepare specifically for those, so you will need to use the resources NBCOT offers through its website.(Also, the review tests in this book will not give you feedback on whether you would have passed the test. You can get that feedback, however, by taking the NBCOT practice exams on the web, which will give you your score.)[Good luck, test takers!]

"Maybe Deserves a 3 star, all so subjective: Melvin Bukeit is a talented writer, no questions on that score. In ""Strange Fire"" what bothered me was Bukiet's cavalier attitude towards his locale: the mideast. His agility and cleverness with languge miss the beat here. He's not a writer who creates caring toward his bizarre (in good and bad sense) characters, nor about their situations. I think he needs to amplify his ability with words with heart. That is just one man's honest opinion. Because, without heart and soul, for lack of better words, the plot isn't intimately gripping.

They practically never leave that house and the plot is so filled with holes that you could drive Giles's Citroen right through it.

"Too small to be useful!: Ordering this book taught me a valuable lesson: take note of the SIZE of the book before buying. This book is so small that it fits in the palm of your hand.

The author, Christopher Tadgell, has written a number of brilliant works, but this little volume has so little space that it can only scratch the barest surface of the Chinese architectural tradition.

I just want to say that the story of Jamilah, the average-sized beauty, and Darius is just breathtaking. I couldn't get enough of the unveiling love and romance between them. Ms. Faye did an excellent job developing those two. Also, the story of Sabrina dealing with the physical and emotional abuse was very touching. Ms. Faye did a wonderful job giving her readers a look into what abused women are subjected to. It was nice to see Sabrina change her tune and find a real man. Hats off to Ms. Faye!

"awesome combo: My biggest concern was how well is it weighted both with and without the saw in the handle, and without the saw in the handle is it strong enough to even chop without breaking? But my concerns were thrown out the door when I got my hands on it, it doesn't feel awkwardly weighted with or without the axe in the handle and the plastic handle is certainly strong enough to hold up without the saw in the handle. The saw is a good saw and so is the axe, but I'd recommend sharpening it a bit before going out to the wild and realizing you wish you had sharpened it a little, it'll get by no question, but a little sharper means a little less work. I bring this with me every backpacking trip I'm going to be building a fire whether I need it or not, it's great to have.

"Clipse: Not Too Short: I'm writing this not as a review but in response to some of the Amazon reviewers who wrote that Clipse's Hell Hath No Fury is too short an album. Listen rap fans: the problem with many full-length hip-hop albums is the obligatory 49 tracks per CD (not to mention the 12 interludes and 18 hidden bonus tracks) where you're sure to find loads of filler and -- as a result -- be turned off by what could have been a masterpiece had it been whittled down to a select few songs. The average pop CD contains a total of 12 tunes, so it's refreshing that Clipse didn't conform to the usual hip-hop excess (and created something of a classic in the process).

I have never had a problem seeing the Bennetts as my contemporaries. Anyone who reads this book will immediately recognize these characters and their situations.

"Utterly frustrating: Indeed it would have been nice if Motorola Phone Tools would work under OS X, but I wasn't really counting on it in the first place.However, even for a computer addict like me it's cumbersome to say the least, to get it working (after removing all modem drivers, which can be impractical for internetters..). I've been corresponding with their helpdesk for over two weeks now, and although I got it running, it still won't see files that are on the phone (Motorola V3i). The other way around, the phone doesn't see files that are put on it in Phone Tools.Not to mention it won't read addresses from the phone. Updating it to 4.0.4 doesn't help.

"Leaves you wanting more.: I first saw the Inca Babies ""Jericho"" video on the ""In Goth Daze"" compilation and first heard of them at a Deathrock website. I was quite impresssed and I can add little to the five star review above. I ordered the CD last month and so far it seems to me on some tracks they appear to work the genre better than their forbears (e.g., The Birthday Party, The Cramps, and Link Wray). But I'm an Anglophile where alternative music is concerned and I admit to a slight bias in that regard. I subtracted one star because The Cd doesn't include ""Jericho"", ""Sense Of Loss"", ""No Sacred Sound"" and the other songs from the ""Big Jugular"" EP which would have made the Disc even greater.Also the sound should have been re-mastered better. But Cherry Red have always had problems re-mastering such music.

"Game of the Decade: After a couple of ventures into the genre by other companies, EA and Dice have gotten it right. I have literally quit playing other games and spent all my time online with this one. The strengths are the diversity of the options that you can play as, and the simplicity of the interface and commands. All of the vehicles are controlled with the same keys and the infantry all use a simple point and shoot firing system. For those who want more complex, the radio message function keys can get fairly complicated. Trying to remember the various combinations to request support or warn other players has gotten me shot a few times. The only other caution that I have is that to fly the airplanes, you really should have a joystick. It can be done without, but it's difficult. Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable shooter, with many elements of stategy that surprise the user. I'm looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment, and the upcoming expansion pack in September.

"The Iron Lady insulted!: This movie is a travesty. I bought it unseen because Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and I anticipated a great story about a great lady and one of the best Prime Ministers Britain has ever had. Instead what I got was an insult to the memory and history of this woman. The movie focuses far too much on her illness after she retired from government service, and very little on the substance and successes of her time in office. I'm sure Meryl Streep deserved her Oscar for her acting since she was very convincing as the Margaret Thatcher I remember in office, but she's not responsible for the content and the ridiculous way the movie kept jumping about from one time period to another. If you are buying this as a historical portrait of a fine leader, then give it a pass. If it's a diary of a fallen heroine suffering the misery of senile dementia you're looking for then enjoy!

"a particularly funny movie: This movie is not really good, it is simply funny !!! Great entertianment indeed, revolving around the prom queen competition at the John Hughes University. The intrigue is very good, besides the intention to focus on Janey is just good. I particularly liked the beginning of the movie (which clearly sets the tone of the movies ), the secret ending too (incredible story about the departure ), and most other sequences anyway(the private catwalk ending under the staircase; the rebound girl pun , the hand job ; the ugly Catherine character etc.).In the middle of all that, Aerola is a special, unexpected bounty. Catherine really looks familiar to those who have already seen Cruel Intentions, she still wants to ave sex with her brother Sebastian (Jake in this movie).... As to Sandy Sue, she is really a likable and very pleasant character.Of course the quality of the images(and the sound) are outstanding from start to end.A joyful movie.

"A superbly presented work of informative scholarship.: In Jewels And Jewelry, Clare Phillips surveys 500 years of western jewelry drawn from the internationally famous Victoria and Albert Museum collection. Phillips covers the materials used, presents a chronology of style, and provides information on manufacturing and distribution including hallmarking and design registration, shops, the tracing of a jewel's history, jewellery boxes, and more. All manner of jewelry is examined, including famous pieces of royalty, and anonymous representatives of unusual design. From rings, brooches, necklaces and pendants to earrings, tiaras, hair combs and buckles, each piece showcased illuminates and documents this collection as one of the finest and most comprehensive in the world today. Jewels And Jewelry is a highly recommended acquisition for personal, professional, academic, and community library collections.

"Antidepressant: I've had this album since I heard the group at the Frog Island Festival in Ypsilanti, MI. It's fabulous and timeless. I've worn out my tape and bought the CD today.The harmonies are breathtaking. The beat is compellingly dance-able. Fascinating accents. We know music effects mood. This album bestows an infectious sense of ""All is well with the world, never mind whatever you're going through, come dance!"" (which is amazing considering that Apartheid seemed an insurmountable evil during the height of this group's popularity in South Africa). My children even think this album is cool.It's a jewel in my music collection.

"A winner: I like to refinish furniture and twenty years ago, this was my bar-none favorite finishing sander. My old one finally gave out and I was urged to try different kinds with this and that and even more this.

So I am back to my first love and very satisfied with its simplicity and dependability.

"""synthetic"" is an advertizing word with no legal connotation - horrible oil: so most people try this stuff and love it right away, and then go out to make a review before they see the problems. Much like a full tank of gas seems to make a car run better in ones mind (or a clean car) these don't have anything to do with a vehicle running. This oil is nothing more than refined and dyed vegetable oil. This oil will shorten the life of any motor and it burns off or creates leaks because of its structure.More than being a huge money maker for the team who markets it as a high performance product, this oil will soon find itself as part of a class action lawsuit. Read the forums online and you will see for yourself. Mechanics will tell you the same thing - stay away from this product and be careful when buying ""synthetic"" type 2 and 3 oils

"Buyer Beware: For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales). However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Darvas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book.

"My Irish Setter pup LOVES IT!: The day I brought my setter pup home, he was ready for the Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy. The little squirrels squeak and he loves to run after him, but after just a couple of days he decided that the whole log was the best toy of them all. He would wrestle with it and drag it around. Great purchase, and a great toy. I do wish that the inside didn't have the scraps of fabric exposed but, so far he hasn't seemed to shred any of them off.

"Video Quality Review (Blu-ray): Monster House, like all well done computer generated features, is very pleasing to look at. Colors are vibrant, depth is strong, and the animation is very life like. Many of the visual effects, particularly towards the end, go straight to that part of the brain which first wanted to upgrade your TV to high definition. But I do feel Monster House stops short of receiving a perfect score, not because of the transfer, but because of the artificial grain filter which the film makers applied. It wasn't obtrusive but it did detract, ever so slightly, from the clarity of the image. Not once did it create the effect of 'Wow, was this shot on film?' but rather 'When are they going to do something about mpeg's dancing dither.' A score of 4.5(PS3 - 1080p projector - 92"")

Am I glad I purchased that book.To this day, I have never seen it in a book store. I must have loaned it to more than 20 friends over the years--all of whom have loved this book. I just had to write a review when I saw it (with a slightly different title) offered at Amazon.Buy this book!

"Just to second many other reviewers....: I sure hope Ms. Gibson (and other authors) read these reviews, and realize some major mistakes were made in this book so that they do not happen again. Others have stated them very well, so I will just add my support - adultery is never sexy, most of us don't like the fu manchu (or at least reading about it over and over ad nauseum) and terrible editing makes a terrible impression on the reader. It's a good thing this is not Gibson's first novel, or many of us might not bother reading her again. Luckily for us all, we know she can do much better, so she will get away with this less-than-stellar addition to her body of work. And I will go re-read ""True Confessions"" so that TwVD is not my last memory of Gospel.

Live worship CDs are obviously the current bandwagon and it's too bad MWS jumped on...this is a really mediocre effort that falls short of what we've come to expect from him. The pieces themselves ARE powerful, if you consider the lyrics of praise to the Lord. But, musically, this CD really isn't anything to write home about...it's lacking real punch that makes it sound different from the Maranatha/Hosanna worship CDs with which we're all familiar. Too bad, because he is such a talented musician and lyricist...he should have considered expending his efforts into developing more original worship works.

"Too many stories that didn't make sense...: I am a fan of micro-fiction, which, when it's written well, allows the reader to think about what he or she has read due to the cleverness and possibly the twist at the end. With that said, short stories (be they short films or literary short stories) are tough to write. Many stories that were chosen for this particular compilation don't make sense, or are very abstract, don't have a definitive beginning, middle, end, or characters a reader should care about. I was personally asking, ""And...?"" or ""What was the point?""Stories shouldn't do that.A few that did catch my attention, and felt ""done"" were:*Chickens by Elaine Magarrel(Chickens attempt to turn the hands of fate)*A Gentleman's C by Padget Powell(A college instructor who finds his aged father a student in his class gets revenge, but regrets it)The story by Powell doesn't have a beginning, middle, and end (or at least a begining and end, sans middle)...but it does comes off as an interesting ""anecdote.""

"JUNK: I owned this vacuume cleaner for about 2 months and hated it every time I used it I finally sent it back to buy a Dyson. It had great suction on hard floors but as soon as it hit carperting and you turned the brushes on they would quit spinning. I would have to hold the vacuume up a little so the brushes could spin and actually pick up dirt and pet hair but it took a toll on my back and a vacuume cleaner should not be that difficult to operate. If the filters were not cleaned every time the canister was emptied it would lose a noticeable amount of suction.

"This product is NOT NUT-FREE!: If you have nut allergies, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is advertised as ""nut-free"", a term that means it has NO NUTS. If you buy it, as I did & read the insert INSIDE THE BOX, it says ""Allergen information: This product manufactured on equipment used for processing peanuts & tree nuts"". I ordered this product because I have had allergic reactions to candies manufactured on equipment used for processing peanuts & tree nuts. ""Nut-free"" means free of nuts. A plain candy bar does not say it is nut-free, it simply says ""milk chocolate"", or whatever it IS, not what it is NOT. ""Nut-free"" is a very specific term, and does not jibe w/the allergen info inside the box. If someone eats this, not having read the insert they can become dangerously, ill.The candy itself is delicious; I loved it before I developed nut allergies, I just want to warn anyone w/the allergy who may believe it is safe to eat.

And when I saw it on this side of the Atlantic in my local record store - 6 drum n' bass CDs for the price of 1, featuring artists like Krust, Roni Size, and Photek - how could I pass it up?Any compilation of this size is bound to contain some filler, and Essential Drum & Bass has its share. There are musicians here that you will never hear their name anywhere else ever again. Some of the tracks differ little in their beats and sounds, and if you're not paying attention it's hard to tell when one track ends and another begins.There are some standout tracks here, but I find it's just a great collection to keep in the car or at work for when you just want an electronic soundtrack to whatever it is you're doing. Throw it on at your next party and you won't have to worry about the beat slowing down.

"A lot like Grisham - and that is not a compliment.: If you like Grisham, you will like this. But I don't like Grisham and I did not like this.It seems to me that works of this sort offer up a plot that moves and not much else. No charaters, no style, no ambience.My preference is for well developed characters, dialogue that is more than plot points and a narrator that can find some subtle nuances. This is more like: Andrew Falcon was smart because he played good poker and the narrator says so. Winthrop is evil because he is manipulative and because the narrator says so. The girlfiend was true because she was a simpleton and the narrator says so. Where is the artistry in that?I also don't like cheap plot devices such as an ex-CIA operative who makes every dirty trick happen so easily. From what comic book did that come from?

"Great to Have; Plastic Could be Slightly More Rigid.: I've been cutting my own hair for the last decade, but I've always been constrained to a hairstyle that's an inch or less long. I wanted longer hair and considered giving up the self-cuts and going to a professional, but I enjoyed having consistent, free-of-charge haircuts with no wait.These attachments have helped immensely. I can leave my hair up to 1.5"" long on top with no problem. The only disadvantage is the semi-flimsy plastic. You just have to make sure that you don't apply force at an angle or they can bend which brings the blade closer to your head. It is also a bit difficult to get a consistent length just due to the limitations of using clippers at longer lengths. I always wash my hair and dry it with my head upside down. I also cut the top with my head upside down to get the gravity assistance needed to make the hair stick straight up while cutting.

"Perennial favorite for this dark time of year: Every year, every single October, I reread this book which my parents gave to me when I was a young child. It is lyrical and evocative of the time when we were children and thought of Halloween as magical. The streets of the town as Halloween begins, the haunted house where Moundshroud lives, the ancient rituals we are led through by Bradbury, the travel through time and history, the underlying message that death will eventually come for us all -- it is ominous yet strangely comforting to read every time. It is not like his other books, but it is a must-read for all of his fans.

"Debut of a Genius: I can imagine the look on a music mogul's face when Alicia Keys walked into his studio to sign a contract. Keys has class, beauty, brains, and plenty of musical talent. In all these years of Hip Hop Rappin Rappers waving their booty, we never thought we would see someone like this. Keys is a female version of Ray Charles. She is original and she is a breath of fresh air.Songs in A Minor has great neo soul tracks, all written in, well, the key of A Minor. There is a little something for everyone. Her rich, mature voice lifts and cradles both the listener and the lyrics on the ballads like Caged Bird and Butterflies. She jams in Mr. Man and Girlfriend. Of course it won a Grammy for Best R&B; album, of course Fallin' won a Grammy in 2002 for Best Song, of course she was voted best new artist. But that ends up being irrelevant, as she is a comet streaking far above anyone else.

I hope I did not throw away the old timer it replaced which while a little less nice ran for at least 4 years before I took it out.

"Learn Java by Association with C Cobol Fortran Pascal Visual: I am a VB programmer who wants to learn Java. This book is nothing it claims to be. One can't learn Java using it. Basically book is just a series of code examples with almost no comments and no clear and full explanations. It might be used as a quick reference but many examples of incorrect VB code I found in the book prevent me from trusting Java code examples. I wouldn't recommend to by this book: in my opinion it's a waste of money.

"Misleading Title: Despite it's title this video has little to do with Tweety or anyone that would normally be considered his friends. Of the five shorts in this video, only one has tweety in it and then, only as a secondary character. These shorts date from preWWII and are of very very early Looney Tunes (pre Mel Blanc?). Very poor sound and video quality. I suggest Sylvester & Tweety, friends of Space Jam which is Classic, late 60's early 70's, Mel Blanc (who does all the voices for the characters) Looney Tunes, with no real connection to Space Jam other than the label on the box.

"Ele-FLOP: This looked so cute and my kids laughed when they saw it on tv so I decided to get it and returned it the same day. The fan barely pushes out the butterflies and 10 shoot out the first minute followed by nothing! My kids were bored and annoyed after only a few minutes of this game. Save your money and do not buy it and if you do, wait for it to get clearanced. I saw so many people buying it for Xmas and wanted to tell them not to get it.

"Rolodex Laptop stand is a great addition for home office: The Rolodex laptop stand is a great addition to a home office.

"Review of Orexis: 60 year old male in very good health and good condition but fading libedo. Have taken 2 capsules of Orexis per day for last 30 days with no decernable effect. The possibity of a minor change is the only reason for the 2 instead of a zero or 1 star.No side effects so the possiblity that some of the contents might have a long term value might make this product worthwhile if cost is not a consideration. Otherwise, suspect that off-the-shelf vitamens might be equally good and effective.

"Great Freshman Release: Holland Nix, a Nashville artist, does not fit into any cookie-cutter musician stereotype. Earthy voice, earthy look, pure style... This CD is a stripped-down production in the sense that it's not over-produced as so many rock/pop projects are today. Holland's vocal delivery is honest - you will find yourself listening to the lyrics, as you should, instead of having them get lost in the over-use of a lead guitar. My favorite cut is the Airplane Song. I travel a lot and it's hilarious how she expresses every traveler's lament. Don't buy this record if you're looking for a shiny record label symbol of ""music"". Buy this if you are looking for an awesome journey through poignant lyrics delivered by an honest, if not sometimes awesomely imperfect, voice.

"Excellent CD: This CD is AWESOME. I originally found out about Over it from a Rufio show. I was bored one night and had a friend come with me to see Rufio. I researched a little on Over It and thought they were pretty good. When they hit the stage I was suprised. They were on tee on all songs. All the sounds were catchy but not crappy Good Charlotte pop punk. The songs have substance. I grabbed the CD and keep listening to it. ""Shine"", ""Siren on the 101"", and ""Waiting"" are the best on the CD.I highly suggest Over It's ""Silverstrand"". Pick it up now before they get big. I can see them blowing up soon.

During one of my many trips from Virginia to NY I decided to take my Shark with me and it worked out great. Now after a long drive or after a little spill in the van I just clean it up with my vacuum. My favorite feature is the rotating brush attachment.

"Emily's Speak Book Review: Laurie Halse-Anderson's novel, Speak, is a riveting story about a teenage girl starting her high school days as an outcast. The main character, Melinda, had called the cops on the end-of-the-summer bash and everyone is busted. The reason for calling the cops is something Melinda keeps deep inside and does not reveal until the end. This novel shows Melinda as she struggles with many difficult aspects of high school and her home life. She has trouble speaking to people and expressing her true emotions. Though she's still very apprehensive, one person she starts to open up to is Mr. Freeman, her art teacher. He has taught her how to express her feelings through art and also told her he'd always be there to listen. Will Melinda finally open up to him or anyone, and find her voice? I enjoyed this novel because it was realistic and detailed. It is a book that brings forth a mixture of emotions. It will make you laugh, cry, and yell out in anger. I definitely recommend this book.

"I love this book!!: I have read ""self-help"", ""regain your personal freedom"" and ""take back your life"" books, but never have I read anything as simple and elegant as The Four Agreements. This book makes sense! It does not over-analyze human behavior, it does not judge human behavior, it does not dictate what is right and wrong. It does not criticize the beliefs of other religions, philisophies, cults and organizations. It offers a simple, yet wonderful, positive way to live your life and to open your heart to those around you. This book encouraged me to live a more productive, loving life and to better understand and relate to those around me. Even people I do not know!! I love this book!Kudos! :o)

"Comfortable!: I recently bought a box of Pampers for my elderly great-uncle, who is incarcerated at the local old-age home. Not only are they comfortable, he says, but he can walk quite fast with them on and he adores the little Sesame Street characters. Easy to use, easy to clean up. Although the fit is a bit tight, there have been no rashes thus far.Now if only he'd sit still when they dole out the apple sauce!Since great-uncle Horace was so pleased with them, I bought some Pampers for my kids and they LOVED them! In fact, they looked so happy wearing them that I decided to wear one to work.A few people around the office commented on my slightly inflated rear, but it didn't bother me in the least. Pampers are much more comfortable and functional than regular underwear. And the best part is, I didn't have to get up every time I needed to relieve myself!I can't wait to go to work tomorrow!

"Timequake not worth the time: I only forced myself to finish reading Timequake because I was still expecting something really brilliant or witty to happen (certainly misled by the cover reviews). But the truth is, it doesn't happen.With all due respect to a great writer, this book is a big disappointment.In my eyes, Vonnegut's narration is that of a semi-senile, proud man. He repeats; he explains and clarifies the obvious (killing even the slightest chance of irony); he holds an authoritative tone of ""Listen to this:""; and he boasts about his life's achievements like a grandfather to his grandchildren.Not the book I had hoped for.

"Dewalt Tools Really Are The Best!!: I bought this router because I needed to make some fancy doors on cabinets I was building. This is a great tool. The router is powerful and did not have any problems cutting through hard oak. This is a great kit because sometimes you don't need the plunge base and it's much easier to cut free hand with the fixed base, smaller, more sleek. The dust collection in the plunge base isn't that great but that could be because my shop vac isn't that powerful. I have used this tool a lot and would buy it again if I had to do it over.

"The (End Of The) Watch: I knew THE WATCH was going to be bad from the get-go. However, the only reason this reviewer wanted to check the film out was to see British actor Richard Ayoade who was so hilarious on the Brit sit-com, THE IT CROWD. His talents are wasted in the film as his character is as stupid as everyone else in the film. The film is another failed attempt to mix paranormal with comedy that hardly works (GHOSTBUSTERS being the exception), and we've seen Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, etc., play variations of these types of characters so many times in other films that they seem to be morphing into each other. Predictable, not fun to watch, terrible script, and characters we don't care about makes THE WATCH just another tax write-off for 20th Century Fox.

"Static buildup and big cracks.: I got mine as an early father's day gift as a replacement for the Michael Graves blade grinder (also by B&D) and noticed that the grinds stick to the sides and lid of the cup. I assumed it was something that would subside over time but it hasn't really. The bean hopper developed a crack after a couple of months which expanded and now the entire section is kept intact by some packing tape. The little hump that keeps the beans flowing has broken off, probaly due to the constant tapping to try and keep the beans flowing into the grinder mechanism. Oh, and the lid for the grinds cup doesn't fit well resulting in a messy counter and a very annoyed wife.

"Frustrating: I got this for my 9-year-old to do for a school project. It said it was fine for children over 8. The directions were terrible. Few words and lots of inaccurate photos to aid in the construction. The insturctions do not allow for the thickness of mortar in between the bricks to be able to hold it together. There was quite a bit of dissolving of mortar and redoing in order to build this. I'm a civil engineer so it's not as if I don't know what I'm doing. In the end, I ended up doing 90% of the construction for him. It was for a school project, so because mom had done so much for him, he had to do something else to show the work he did.

"Don't buy if you have a big dog: Buyer beware! The photo shown on Amazon is not the product sold. I have attached my own photo so you can see that there is no reinforced edge on this cone. My 70 lb German shepherd managed to crack the outer edge of the cone on the first day when she banged it against a cabinet while turning around. In less than one week, she's managed to crack it in several places and is now held together by our ""decorative"" duct tape. The velcro closures (also not shown as they are in the photo-they really run the length of the cone in several spots for a variable fit) work quite well, so if Kong had just used a stronger material and a reinforced edge, this would be a much better product.Trust me, if you have a large / strong dog, keep looking. This cone is not for you!

"Questionable reliability, *very* heavy: Tnis string trimmer worked well out of the box, those it was *much* heavier than my previous Weedeater Featherlite. It did a better job than the Featherlite in long weeds, but still bogged down from time to time, which surprised me considering the unit's heft. The buump-and-feed mechanism was also less than ideal, causing me to have to stop the trimmer frequently to ""manually"" let out more string.But these quibbles became moot after the trimmer ceased to function after using it on a very hot day at the end of July. The unit will now only run for a minute or two; after warming up it stalls and cannot be restarted. It would appear that it overheated on that hot day and is now seriously damaged (and yes I did use the proper 40-1 oil mixture).BTW, the Troy-Bilt gas trimmers are manufactured by MTD.

The most well-known song off the album, ""I Love It Loud"" has a solid bass drumbeat which makes it a great footstomper. The best song on the album is ""War Machine"". This track is absolutely amazing! Gene is really growling on ""War Machine"". This is a classic album that should cannot be ignored.

"Cheap: I thought Korg would be a great brand to buy, but this metronome is so cheaply made. It looks like it maybe cost them a dollar to make, including the labor. At the highest volume it is just not loud enough to be heard over the piano. It was impossible for me to open just to put the batteries in. My husband, with his stronger fingers had to do it. You have to push in two side tabs and pull apart the two halves of the box to insert the batteries next to the little circuit board. I was worried I would accidentally move something around in there and mess up the whole unit. If I would do it all over again, I wouldn't pay more than about $8 for it.

"Works great, but I found it unnecessary: While the Whirley-Pop is a wonderful kitchen gadget, I found an equally effective popcorn popper in my kitchen cupboard. It's called a heavy-bottomed pot with lid. Considering I already owned one (er, several), I thought I'd give it a whirl. It pops up a huge soup pot full of delicious popcorn in just a couple of minutes. In fact, my jar of Orville Redenbacher's popcorn kernels has excellent instructions printed right on the label. My only adjustment is to give my pan an occasional shake to prevent burning. I don't know whether this makes any difference or not, but that's what I do.So, yes, the Whirley-Pop is nice, but I'll stick to my soup pot.

"Really: Edgar Cayce said during a seance something to the effect. Why ask for guidance from ur dead drunk father, he is still a drunk. Meaning his level of thinking is still the same. The act of dying doesn't purify you of ur character defects, according to him.And this is also interesting: The Tibetans believe in reincarnation to the point that they track down where the soul of the deceased Dali Lama had ""landed"" (finding which child he had reincarnated into) in order to continue his education. For the Tibetans the natural reincarnation process is too random. So, to make sure that Dali Lama upbringing would not be wasted on an ignorant peasants family they went and got him. If the Tibetans are on to something what happened to all those other great men and women after they died. Did they end up in some dysfunctional family and having their development thwarted.For greater detail read wikipedia article on Dali Lama under (4) Searching for the reincarnation.[...]

"Not durable: Generally I review products months after I have bought it. That is because I believe it takes atleast a month or more for the initial enthusiasm and excitement to fade away. I have been a great Sennheiser fan. I own three headphones. All three are sennheiser. One is for sport and gym; the other is for travel and this is the one for home. I bought these headphones four months back. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about its sound quality. It is definitely worth the price or probably more. But the chord is too long and does not have a proper protection at the end where it connects the ear piece. This makes it too vulnerable to break and consequent disconnection.While my last home headphones (also sennheisser) lasted for a year and two months, this one lasted for four months. This is frustrating.This review would help people who are fussy about durable heaphones.I give 0.5 /5 for its durability.Thanks

"D&D for a new generation of players (buyers): I must admit that I have been disgusted with the onslaught of books stamped with Second Edition. Falling off the shelves like overpriced amendments to a perfectly good constitution. It was about time they did what should have happened long ago, admit that the game has changed. Most people starting D&D in the past few years would have had to shell out about 200 just to get a peice of the full Second Edition Library. It is time to get back to basics, use fewer 'standardized' rules, and get the player's imagination back into the game. I would hope that those looking for a strong backbone to role playing will stick to the basic book(s), and use their own ideas to fill in the gaps. If you have them, stick to the old rules set in your old 1st and 2nd editions and save your money! This game is about a players ability to think. It shouldn't have anything to do with the amount of books you can buy. Save your money for miniatures and cool dice.

"Not worth the money: This product was very easy to assemble. Do not be fooled by the weight of the dresser. It is very heavy, but not in the least bit sturdy. The tracks for the drawers are held in by the shortest screws I have ever seen and pop right out of the side. Try not to hammer the wooden dowels too hard, they will break through the other side. After about a month, 3 of the 6 drawers would not close properly, so after spending $200.00 on this dresser, I now have to purchase another one to replace it.

Also, it provides good belly support, which I'm finding is a necessity at over 7 months pregnant. The problem that I have is the with the case. The seams on the inner curve of the pillow cut into my neck and shoulders, leaving me with marks and pain in the mornings. I quickly switched the orientation of the pillow, so that the head part is down at my feet, and it works okay, but it's disppointing that it doesn't work for me as intended. If the case was made to be seamless on the inner curve, this pillow would be fantastic.

Now, I have friends who will help me find a suitable horse, but as a supplement, this book has been very informative and I feel a lot better about the search.

Soy milk or orange juice would leak out everywhere, I dealt with it for a while because the blender was new and it was a hundred dollars. I made my last angry smoothie and dumped the thing in the trash. I'm using my food processor until I can find a better blender. Because of the split and cracks that happened at the base of this jar, I wouldn't recommend this product.

"A Page-Turner Especially for Lovers of Spain: In A Handful of Kings, Mark Jacobs combines a taut thriller plot with a love story, and fleshes it out with a wealth of detail about Spain and the American Foreign Service. I was engaged by the three-dimensional characters and caught up in the action as the story unfolded.Living in Madrid, I was doubly delighted to see this city feature so prominently in the novel (even though the action takes place also in Colombia and the United States). As Jacobs writes about an encounter in Madrid's El Retiro Park, for example, I could picture the scene vividly in my mind. He also does a great job of capturing the intangible things that make Madrid Madrid, even down to the Ducados cigarette smoke filling up one's favorite Spanish bar. Jacobs, who was a former Foreign Service Officer, does a wonderful job of opening a window onto the environment of a U.S. embassy and the people who run it for the general reader.

The characters are one-dimensional and completely unrealistic, the story is a hodge-podge of cliches bunched together in a completely implausible fashion.

"Don't bother.: I usually give a book 50 pages to get me hooked before giving up on it. For some reason I gave this one about 70 - it took that long to get into the interesting bits. The world as populated by chimpanzees was fascinating and enjoyably vulgar until it got repetitive. The book is interesting enough to keep reading - there were several intriguing parallels and some rather funny episodes -but is not good enough to recommend.

"Nickel Creek: This disc is OK. It sounds too much like Alison Krauss for my taste. Her music is too austere - not enough picking. They seem to be pretty good, the music doesn't appeal to me. When it comes to Bluegrass, I like Del McCoury, Ricky Skaggs, and Blue Highway.

"Worth Reading: Cahill is a very skilled writer and many will find this a fascinating read. He is also a skillful researcher. Unfortunately Cahill seems to be unable to see characters outside of his twenty first-century context. He essentially ignores any evidence to the contrary (Historian John Bury for one) and describes Patrick as a devil may care schismatic. Then with the same myopic twist proceeds to paint Saint Augustine as a bitter representative of a dying religion. He bemoans the fact the Church has followed Saint Augustine, gleefully reports an instance of ceremonial bestiality, for some reason which only he is aware of, inserts gratuitous profanity, and insanely credits Irish piety as a chance to out ""Victorian"" the English. Still all in all the pluses out weigh the minuses and this book is worth reading.

"Real simple, real good, down-home food.: Mickler's self-deprecating portrayal of Southern prole culture is absolutely hilarious! But, even 'though this book is laugh-out-loud funny, it is no mere joke-book. Make no mistake -- these are real recipes that work. I took this cookbook with me when my family was relocated, for my husband's job, to live in Silicon Valley for three months in a corporate apartment and forced to make do with a bare-bones kitchen containing three foil-thin skillets and a rectangular Pyrex baking pan. Amazingly, these recipes were simple enough that I was able to make easy and delicious meals everyday with a minimum of implements and without need for fancy ingredients. This is, simply put, real folks' home-cooking. By the way, you have got to try Irma Lee Stratton's Chocolate Dump Cake! It is the chocolate cake recipe I had been searching for, the moistest and fudgiest chocolate cake I have ever had. You won't even want to add frosting, it's that good!

The kid who played Dill annoyed me and was such a dork compared to Dill in the book. The main reason I give it 2 is because the only person I enjoyed in the whole film was Gregory Peck...well, him and Robert Duvall (who doesn't speak).IF YOU HAVE READ THE BOOK, DON'T WATCH THIS!

"Author gives up at the end: The first 2/3 of the book does a good job of holding your interest. Chapters alternate between first person, as the main character recounts her experiences, and third person, allowing the reader to view the evil goings-on elsewhere. But just as the book builds to a climax, the author gives up. The situations are resolved without saying how or in really amateurish fashion. Multiple subplots are never finished. In one case, the judge references a situation which a few pages earlier we are told was kept secret from everyone.The book gives the impression that the author ran out of time as the publication date neared, so he had an eighth grader throw together a few quick pages to wrap things up.An aspiring author might want to read the first 2/3, set the book aside, and then write an ending for themselves. They'll probably do better than James Patterson did.

"Pretty Good: Got the Dirt Dog for a couple of days and I've been using it to clean our apartment floors. We live in a 3000 square feet apartment and most of the flooring are tiles with low pile area rugs. I have a Lhasa Apso that doesnt shed too much but we can still see fur balls flying about every week.I made sure I lift the cables or use a old cardboard core that came with our area rugs to block off the underneath of tv shelves to make sure it does not get caught with all the wires.So far I am pretty pleased. We were very shocked to see how much dust and hairs it was able to to pick up.I'm planning to buy a roomba and a scooba to alternate with the Dirt Dog to get our house cleaned on a regular basis. I might use the Dirt Dog for our huge terrace instead to clean up the sand.I hope this gadget lasts.

"DISSAPPOINTING: As one reviewer said this is a collection of Plasket's games, lightly annotated and grouped into general themes (attacking castled kings, pushing rook pawns, etc).

"2 Girls are too many, 3 is a Crowd, and 4 ya dead!: Face to Face is nice album that introduces the kinks into their golden period of rock music. The songs that make Face to Face so strong are: Dandy, Rosie Please Come Home, Party Line, Rainy Day in June, Fancy, Holiday in Waikiki and Queen of Darkness. It does seem Ray enjoys mocking the rich, songs like House in the Country and Real Estate song are tracks that kinda drag out those themes too much. You can see a split between the brothers on this album also. Dave seems to be still stuck in 65' while his brother Ray pushes onto 66' with his more envolved numbers. But isn't it always like that ?

"Can science and herbs co-exist? Yes!: What makes this book stand out from the many hundred others out on the market is that it approaches the effects of herbs on the nervous system from a scientific, rather than pseudo- or anti-scientific, perspective.

This book should be in every psychologist's, psychiatrist's, and physician's book shelf.

"Major disappointment after the excellent ""Spider-Man 2"": ""Spider-Man 3"" is a big disappointment after the heights reached by ""Spider-Man 2"".The villains are uninspired, the plot is just a random collection of ideas that doesn't add up to much, the relationship issues between Mary Jane and Peter Parker have become tiresome.The film looks like it has undergone some major post-production cutting (witness Mary Jane's unexplained breakup with Peter Parker) but it is all to no avail.The creators seem to have run out of compelling ideas.

"A Fresh Perspective: It's about bi-s exuality, and Will S. does more than reveal himself in A Letter. He provides a varied perspective on the tangles of human sexuality, using both his own intimate revelations and, more importantly, sources ranging from right brain to left. Philosophers, poets, songwriters, biologists, judo examples and mathematically charterd graphs exemplify the range of his input. The reading flows. The message is both honest and thought provoking. The personal struggle is evident and the mix of subjective and objective perspecitves is unusually fresh and insightful.

"A great tribute to a great man: This is part a biography of Douglas Adams, and part a description of how the different versions of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy came to be. Douglas Adams was a very interesting and intelligent man whose life was cut tragically short. The story of how his most famous work was created is almost as funny and capticating as the Hitchiker's Guide itself. We get some examples of his early work, which can be incredibly funny (""How many kamikaze missions have you flown?"" ""Fourteen Sir!"" ""Shouldn't it be just one?""). He was involved with the Monty Python group, and wrote some material for them.I think the book should be essential not only for Hitchhiker's buffs but also for wannabes in any creative profession.

"The Author has no clue.: The author is a foreign-born and sees the goodies only. He is naive, has no clue on some issues. Yes, America is very good country for a foreigner to live in, yet he fails to see Vietnam war, slavery, low wages. I have not read his book, and I will never. I have seen him on C-Span, telling point blank that 'This (US) is the only super power in the world that doesn't tell other countries what to do"" I don't know what part of the world he lives. He is comparing Zhengis Khan with Modern America. Simply the person has no clue. Now-a-days, especially after 9/11, a lot of pudnits get pleasure comparing our (US) system of government, the ways of living comparing with Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq. The aforementioned countries have not come out of Middle Age.

"Essential early 90s metal!: Non Fiction was a great band from New Jeresey who made a handful of records in the early 90s. They kind of sounded like a more metal Soundgarden, as a simplified example. If they were around today they'd probably get lumped into the doom metal genre. Anyway, this cd combines their first two cd's, both of which are incredible, with some demos and unreleased cuts. without question one of the most overlooked bands of the 1990s, these guys should have been HUGE. Great singing, amazing riffs, great grooves, it's all there. Highly, highly recommended!!! Buy!!

"Alex on We Were Soldiers Once...: Overall, this was a good book. The authors did an excellent job of describing the harsh realities of war. This was definately not the glossed-over Hollywood version of the war in Vietnam. These men were not the drugged-out hippie draftees portrayed in movies, they were soldiers just doing their job. This is definately not a children's book, as it is rather graphic and fairly long. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in U.S. history, especially those interested in the the highly controversial Vietnam War.

If you're not sure about which jazz piano CD to buy as a gift for a friend or maybe for yourself, make the decision easy - buy two of this one. Give one away, keep one for yourself, and listen to it a few times. You'll find something new each time. Dave's sytle is so rich, fluid, swinging, musical, and fast, that you just can't hear it all in one go. Incredibly, it sometimes sounds as if there are four hands playing. At others you simply can't take your ears off of his amazing swinging bass lines. Then all of a sudden he surprises you by seemlessly dropping in a few lush chords, then goes back to the swinging line, all the while jsmming with the right hand. It's just great music.

"it's crap: i read a review of 1 guy having 3 broken ones. about a week ago i broke my third headset... i was so disgusted. I took good care of it, but the little plastic piece that everyone talks about finally broke. Everything about this headset is perfect except for 2 things. 1: some of the headsets have weak hold on where the microphone holds up. This means every time you put on this headset you might have to adjust it... and it's annoying because it's a loose adjust. 2: The infamous piece of plastic that everyone who has a broken headset knows about. It's a console headset yet they make it like it's on your computer desktop. Screw you, microsoft! 30 dollars for this piece of junk. I had to put a screw in my other 2 headsets now they work great.If you get this headset, take good care of it. Leave it in the SAME SPOT every single time you put down your controller. That's the only way you're going to keep it alive for more than a year. Know where it is at all times.

"This is the Chaplin film to avoid....: This film is not without some merit, but overall, it's pretty disappointing, considering it's a Charlie Chaplin film. Out of Chaplin's five sound films, this is the one to avoid. It seems Mr. Chaplin was trying to put Marlon Brando in a role Chaplin himself would have performed in his heyday. But Chaplin was obviously too old to play the tramp (he was 77 when he made this), so he put Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren through the antics. There are a few funny moments, a lot of doors slamming, some nice humanistic touches, but most of it just seems tired. The supporting performances are very subpar, the editing is quite awkward, and the atmosphere of the film is almost dirge like. A rather sad experience, especially if you're a Chaplin fan. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's very disappointing....

"Dropped once and stopped working: I purchased this pedometer based on another person's review which raved about its durability. It worked great the first day until I leaned over to pick something off the floor at my office. The pedometer popped off my waistband, fell about 2 feet to a carpeted floor, and stopped calculating completely. Needless to say, I was disappointed that the pedometer didn't even make it through the first 24 hours and sent it back. I understand that pedometers should be ""motion sensitive"", but given the punishing that runners and hikers put them through, they should certainly be able to survive the occasional drop -- especially to a carpeted floor. I do not recommend this product.

"after 8 months of use: I bought the player because of its compatibility with formats from Audible - audio books. After 8 months, the battery is at 30% of its supposed strength, if you are lucky you can use it 3 hours instead of the claimed 11 hours. The battery dies real quick even if you do not switch it on. The display is flimsy. Hard to read - the oval display does not allow to see the full text. The menu has a lot of features, and 128MB is quite helpful, if your battery makes it. The box is made of cheap material that can break to easy. I also own a Rio 500,which is not working anymore.These are my last buys of Rio products. I do not understand its popularity: must be good marketing. I recommend using a device with AA battery slots, so you can put fresh power in, where ever you are.

"If you like ""Wanna Be a Baller"", you'll like this more!: Yungstar's double-disc debut opens up with an intro commenting on the importance of keeping his name in the game, riding high on the success of Lil' Troy's ""Wanna Be a Baller"". This album picks up where that song leaves off, giving you tales of floss and gloss, laced with some of the phattest beats around. This CD is so nice, Epic picked it up after its independent success, but that is not without error. First, they took off a song relying heavily on a sample of Michael Jackson's ""PYT (Pretty Young Thing)"", which was my personal favorite on the album. Second, they took off a bonus track that was nearly twenty minutes long, featuring at least as many artists! The free second disc with the new release makes up for that, however, pick up both if you get the chance!

"Funky music that suits the series: There is no mistaking that this is Trigun. You can just see Vash and the gang of goodies and baddies in action. Definitely has some very catchy tunes. It also has some very odd pieces that just seems to fill in air space. The last number is strangely monotonous without any melody to it, which kind of disapponts. You'd expect it to be something memorable rather than an odd droning noise that seemed to go on far too long. But, it's worth it for the good titles, which far outnumber the non-good ones.

On the song ""Shoot 'em Up"", Havoc produces the albums best beat and on ""Family"" the Mobb showcases their great lyrics. ""Nasty Nas to Esco to Escobar/ Now I be/ Nastradamus"".

"Delightful surprise: I've read and enjoyed most of Grisham's legal thrillers to date, and checked this one out with some trepidation as I recall hearing that not only was it not his usual genre, but it just wasn't quite up to his usual standards. Well, I just finished it and I'm hoping he'll write a sequel! What a delight. Engaging style, intriguing characters, plenty of suspense, good humor, moments of sadness, ideal pace, even learned more about cotton farming than I'd ever known. And to top it off, baseball sprinkled liberally throughout, though I'm not a Cardinals fan.

"FRESH, FUN, & ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE: I just discovered Stella and Sam this weekend and they are now officially my favorite children's characters ever! The brother and sister relationship has never been explored with such sweet simplicity. A worried Sam asks the truly stellar Stella question after question after question, and she answers with pizazz and panache, until Sam can't help but be influenced by her infectious enthusiasm. Their paunchy little-kid stomachs and Stella's flame-red hair are sooooo cute that the book would be worth the buy even for the pictures. Luckily you don't have to compromise - the dialogue makes it difficult to read without laughing aloud and the story flows with a fresh feeling that is completely enjoyable.

It was a diabolical torture device, designed to break our hearts right in front of our classmates.Well, 20 years later, I read ""Marley"" in the privacy of my home and laughed, cried and cried some more.Grogan expertly, perfectly captures the journey dog owners experience with a pet. As the co-owner of two rescue dogs, a springer-pointer mix named Daisy and a parti-colored cocker spaniel named Derby, this book rekindled many memories, and yes, horrors.Grogan isn't pretentious and frankly, his emotionally raw book is at its best when describing the worst times. As the new mom of a one year old, ""Marley"" also painted a nice portrait of what life has in store for us.Grogan really crafted a wonderful story that you will devour as quickly as Marley devoured his leash on the movie set. Seriously, folks... it is a great book and I think it is wonderful that Marley lives on in his own special way.

"Does not work with BMW factory radio: I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci with a factory BMW radio (not Harmon Kardon). The Belkin will charge through the cigarette lighter but does not fit quite right, it wiggles around. When I use the attachment ring provided in the box it won't fit at all. The iPod will charge and play when in the cradle but no signal transmits to the radio. I literally spent 1.5 hours, first by myself, then with a gadget-knowledgable friend, going through every single FM frequency. Nothing but silence, even with the iPod volume turned all the way up. The iPod works fine with head phones, by the way.Granted, I may have gotten a defective Belkin, but I won't be trying another one for the simple fact that it won't even fit my cigarette lighter snugly.BMW Owners- be sure to read the return policy carefully before you buy this!

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME - IT'S BUGGED!!: This game at first looks seems amazing, but as you play it, you bump into the swing bug. If you want to play the game where you actually use the controller as a golf club, you ""lose"" swings. Occasionally, (about 4 times in a 9 hole round for me), the game misses your swing. You take your backswing as normal, but when you bring it around for the hit, the game jumps the gun and hits it too early. This results in a weak, off target shot.I can't think of anything more frustrating than to play a good hole right up to the short shot and then have the game mess up in this way, causing you to lose the hole and possibly the match.In short, this game is bugged. Don't buy it!

Devil - Sorry wrong number.hmmn, ok ok that's just my far off recollection of the lines but I laugh just thinking about the 'Unholy One' making prank phone calls from up a telephone pole. This 60s british comedy is a re-telling of Faust by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore and although slow in one or two places, is fantastically well written, funny, and stylish. Moore is the suicidal burger flipper who sells his soul to the devil played by Cook. God and Raquel Welch are also featured. Hollywood, is of course doing a remake (why? why?)A definite cult classic. Cook is fantastic as the devil and was a true genious in comedy writing. Moore... well anyone who could write a title song as cool as the one in Bedazzled can't be all bad - Dudley - you were half a genious.

"STIFFLING, SUFFOCATING, GIMME AIR, QUICK!: If you liked Smiley's 1000 Acres, you'll like this book. I liked neither. I felt in both books like I was going through someone's dirty laundry basket ... there was nothing uplifting...nothing to capture the imagination. The ""heroine"" of A Map of the World was truly unlikable to me. She was self-absorbed and not anyone I could care about. Her children were despicable, and her husband a tight-lipped drone. The only reason I give the book even 3 points is that it opens with a bang. The action that gets the whole story in motion happens more quickly than in any other novel I have read. Perhaps that's why the rest of the book seems so slow and tedious. I might add, If you like books with a little ""poetry"" in them, or books that leave something to the imagination (such as The God of Small Things), skip this one. Everything's laid out in tedious and unending detail.

"LEAKED!: I read all of the positive reviews on this bag, and really wanted to like it. However, I used it for 2 days and it leaked terribly! Also, it caused a real headache in the washing machine. The bag would fill up with water but it wouldn't all drain out in the spin cycle, so the remaining water would drip all over my diapers, getting them too wet to throw in the dryer, and requiring me to do an extra spin cycle. What's the point of a pail liner if it's going to leak and cause extra work on laundry day? Now I just throw my dipes straight into the pail, and disinfect the pail while the wash is running. So much easier than dealing with the bag. I don't know what I'm going to do with the bag at this point - I'll either use it as a dry laundry bag, or return it.

"Does the job.: The outer case is well-constructed and padded. The inner case, which fits directly over the player, gives every appearance of providing good protection. It does require a little patience to get it well-positioned for access to the controls. The access could be better, especially for people with large fingers. You will probably find yourself using your finger nail rather than finger. The screen protector is not difficult to install as some have suggested, but you will not get a smudge-free screen. On the other hand, when the player is turned on, the smudges are not noticeable. Toss the ear buds and use high quality earphones and the size of the outer case becomes irrelevant.

"Best reference history: I agree with a previous reviewer that there are some editorial problems with this English translation/revision of Conte's work (e.g. ""Revelations"" for the last book of the Bible -- most literate people know that the book is titled ""Revelation""). Nonetheless this is the best available reference history of Latin literature, replete with facts as well as appreciation. Coverage extends well into the Middle Ages, with brief discussions of even minor figures. This book is clearly to be preferred over the Latin volume of the Cambridge History of Classical Literature, which (as the preface to Conte's book says) is just a collection of essays ""varying in approach and critical acumen...while presupposing the reader's command of all the elementary facts"".

The set of children's pieces are a real treat within this collection of legit repertoire. The picture of her in her advanced years, still happily playing, gives us all hope and perspective on a life living and loving music.Non-musician freinds of mine have commented on how lovely the album is, so this is one that can be completely enojoid by the novice and the afficianado alike. So far, this is one of my top two fave albums of harp music. (The other is Marisa Robles' ""Harp Concertos"", harp with orchestra.) Thank you Linda, for this lovely gift!

"To bad...: Unfortunately, this book suffers from the same problem as many other Java books. The author believed it necessary to explain what Java is in the first 8 chapters, instead of assuming some previous knowledge on the subject (there are plenty of better books out there on beginning Java). Game programming is an indepth field, and unfortunately is not covered in-depth in this book. There are many in-depth books for C, C++ on the subject, but as of yet, none to count for in Java. There are a few games published using Java out there, eg: Vampire:The Maquerade, Roboforge, etc. Maybe the developers for those game should write a book, as of now it's still a neech market.

"Nothing to see here, move along...: Night Gallery holds a special place in alot of hearts. I am one of those people. I adored season 1 and could not wait for season 2 mainly for the Lovecraft tales which I had never seen.With that being said there are some true gems in this collection. ""The boy who predicted earthquakes"" comes to mind and various others.Now with the praise out of the way, on to the problem.Sadly I found myself getting more entertainment out of the EC Archives I was reading while the dvd was playing. Most of the stories or ""paintings"" are some of the most guessable, contrived muck ever put to film. Nothing shocked, surprised, or even amused me 89% of the entire season. Even most of the funny 5-10 minute ones fell flat in a big way.On top of this was the picture and sound. Watchable but nothing to be awe-inspired about. Sound was decent at best.To finish there are some true classics in this season, but the rest drowns it all in obscurity for good reason.

"Tight.: Hardcore: starting to sound all the same? Not anymore; welcome Norma Jean: along with acts like Converge, Give Up the Ghost and the Dillinger Escape Plan can revitalize a genre full of wannabes. Surprisingly unlike most Christian bands that copy a sound of their originator (usually a band that isn't Christian or just isn't labeled ""Christian"") this band is awesome and geniunely real. Don't lump this up in a Focus on the Family crap magazine, because bands like this aren't ALL about being Christian. Just because they don't speak of drugs or what have you doesn't mean they focus on religion 24/7: read the lyrics to the lengthy title: ""I Used to hate Cell Phones but Now I Hate Car Crashes"". Great stuff.

"An Inexpensive Surprise: Mickey Rooney stars in Quicksand, a great film about how a small unnoticeable crime can turn into something large and out of control if one isn't careful. After needing money for a date with a beautiful woman in town (Jeanne Cagney), Dan turns to his cash register at the auto shop where he works for a twenty that he can easily replace later. However, when the accountant comes early to check up on the place, he's in need of cash faster than he planned, so he buys a watch on the installment plan and pawns it for the cash. When he learns this is a crime, he has to come up with $100 in a day, leading to even more problems down the line.Rooney is wonderful in the leading role of this gripping film. His innocent face does not hinder him in this serious part. His kisses are passionate and reason to support why he was such a ladies man.Although this is a bargain DVD, the picture is crisp and clear and the sound quality is good.

"So-so: The two stars that I have given this book belong only to the last section - Part IV (more specifically chapters 15 & 16 - about 17% of the book).I have to agree with other readers of this book in that I found this book too technical and often redundant in sections.If you are looking for a good book on the psychology of trading I would highly recommend Jake Bernstein's ""The Investor's Quotient"" (2nd Ed.).

"The Little Cart That Could: While I'd never put 600 lbs into this cart, it's a wonderful cart for about 100 lbs. The four wheels maneuver easily, and pulling the cart around is a breeze.With the way that the handle is situated, you can easily pull it with both hands behind you. Or one hand, whichever you prefer. Unlike a standard wheelbarrow, the four wheels support a lot of the weight.I use my cart to clean horse stalls, so the plastic bin is perfect. It's been left out in the rain countless times and nothing is rusting.I've had this cart for a few months now and am extremely pleased with it. I would have liked flat-free tires, but for the price, it's a great little unit.Based on the daily use it gets, I think that this cart will easily last me a year--maybe two.

"Stinker: Well to say I was disappointed is quite understating what I felt about for this game. I was expecting Age of Empires 3 not Empire Earth without the bombers. The game has none of the feeling of its predecessors, it has small cramped maps not the sweeping expanses of AoE 1+2, the AI is retarded, there is little logic in advancement, the battle tactics non existent, you can't even set formations. No surprises at all if you have played Empire Earth. In fact EE (which is a really poor game in itself) is much more engrossing than this simplistic, albeit very pretty, direct port of Empire Earth. My kids, whose pocket money was spent on this wasted effort, were even more disappointed than I was.It is not Age of Empires 3, it has neither the feel, game play nor charm of the Age of Empires games series and I look forward to Microsoft & Ensemble Studios actually bringing out the proper Age of Empires 3.

"Not what your thinking.: To anyone who may have read the glowing review of this album in the ""CD Picks"" section of January's ELLE magazine, the one with the gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley on the cover, this message is for you.That review comes off as though this CD is a contemporary version of Classical music. A la Metalica S&M or something. They mention Beck and the Kronos Quartet who are other bands who have pulled this trick off. ""The ensamble makes Schoenberg rock and rock Schoenbergian."" That is a direct quote but do not be fooled by this deceiving and malicious artical by David Yaffe. This music is in no way pleasing to the rock listener. It is uterly appauling and I will never again trust a review from this magazine. What a waste of 18 bucks.

"Poorly organized and hard to use: I recently took a trip to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, and one of the books I took with me was the Insider's Guide. I was disappointed to find that it was the most frustrating guide book that I have ever used. It is so poorly organized! Having the information separated into so many different sections makes it impossible to find anything. For example, I have a son and so I looked at the Kidstuff chapter. It's organized like an alphabet book - which is cute to read but impossible to use. Please re-organize this book - or at least re-do the index. I would like to be able to go to one chapter and find everything in a particular area, not have to read most of the book to find out what's going on in one area.I do think the book is interesting if you have time to sit and read through the whole thing, but I found it very difficult to find things in it.

"Not the One!: I enjoyed the first Elizabeth Bevarly mainstream novel and even those published by Silhouette. However, these last few have missed the mark. ""He Could be the One"" should not have been published as a mass market mainstream novel. The plot is flimsy and was held together by the author repeating the heroine's thoughts and speech repeatedly in order to stretch the story. While Eve and Wyatt's story could have been fantastic if given the proper depth, this rendition only left a disappointed fan. I sensed the secondary character, Eve's sister Simone, might get a story of her own. If so, lets hope the author takes the time to develop the story more fully before going to market. I would suggest buying this used or waiting for a paperback exchange at your local library. I probably won't make another purchase unless I read the reviews first.

"A Long Awaited Story: Salvatore finally writes a story on a character more interesting than the now predictable Drizzt. If you're a big Wulfgar fan, who is sick of hearing about Drizzt, this book is for you. It is a great story told in the classic Salvatore style that made the Icewind Dale heroes perhaps the most popular characters in the Forgotten Realms saga. Spine of the World gives more life, and emotion to the character Salvatore initially intended to be his main hero in the Icewind Dale Trilogy, and once you read the book you will almost wonder why he changed his mind. I for one can't wait for Salvatores next installment in the story of the Icewind Dale heroes (most especially Wulfgar, and Morik).

"Very Disappointing: Any type of child abuse is intolerable, physical, sexual, verbal, mental. However, I don't think a romance book is the place to try to raise awareness of long ago abuse.

If you are looking for either humor or strong characters about which you can care, don't purchase this book. I'm not even sure why I finished this book, I guess I was hoping it would improve.

"Abusing Children is Not Christian Parenting: This book is truly apalling. The so-called Christian methods of the Ezzos have been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics (a very conservative organization) because so many infants whose parents have followed the advice in this book have had to be treated for failure to thrive (read: starving). The Ezzos have no training at all in nutrition or in the mechanics of breastfeeding yet insist in promoting a rigid feeding schedule which causes breastfed babies to starve, promoting the idea that most modern mothers sadly ""can't"" breastfeed. I am not even going to go into their ridiculous ideas about how infants are spoiled if you hold them and attend to them or about how they advocate striking babies. Please avoid this book if you care about your child's health. God does not condone child abuse.

The only cd I can think of by Hypnotic that actually was worth the money was ""A Dose of Psychedelic Trance"". Overall, this is a terrible album. If you like goa trance but aren't sure exactly what to buy, please don't buy this cause you will probably not like goa trance as much anymore. Go to a specialty site...and read the reviews...and buy stuff from labels like TIP world, Blue room released, Krembo, Koyote, Twisted, Boom, they are all good labels and you really cant go wrong. Just stay away from Hypnotic and it's sister label, Cleopatra. This album ended up in the trash after 1 listening, along with ""Otherworld Transmission - Chapter one""

"Dynamic Duo #2: I loved all of Fleisher's recordings with George Szell in the 50's and early 60's before he became afflicted with dystonia. In particular, the Beethoven concertos (still the best stereo cycle of those works), the Grieg/Schumann concertos (still at or near the top), and the Brahms concertos (along with Gilels, the best pairing of those). Fleisher & Szell were quite a dynamic duo. Now over 40 years later comes the best stereo recording I've heard of the piano quintet (yes, I like it better than Pollini/Quartetto Italiano). As for the quartets, there are many fine recordings. I especially like the Verdi Quartett's Op. 51 set. The Alban Berg has a fine set of all three on 2 discs (but inexplicably no ""filler""). But, this set by the Emerson's is as good as any I've heard, and probably better. When you add it all up, it's a no-brainer as to which set to get. Hopefully, this is the first of many collaborations between Fleisher and the Emerson Quartet (while he can still play at this level).

"The T.A.M.I. Show: This is a live show that was taped in 1964. When you think anout 1964, you know that was a pivotal year. The President of the U S was killed the year before, and the Gulf of Tonkin incident, which would escalate the Vietnam war, was just unfolding. We would lose Sam Cooke in 1964. With that historical context, you can enjoy this performance for its role in entertainment where race did not really matter. Even though this was taped during the height of the civil rights movement, the crowd was mixed and allowed to intermingle. The bands and recordings are tight and well preserved. No doubt James Brown is the hightlight, however, all entertainers were at the top of their game. Marvin Gaye is good to look at, being so young. Same is true for The Miracles and Smokey Robinson. This is a DVD you want to have in your collection. I am glad the wait is over!!

This book is not that book.I have the DeLorme atlas for Virginia so I could use these in tandem, but that would be much more time consuming given the alternatives available.I have used various online resources and the FalconGuide for Virginia to layout a much better hike. The book excels at telling what to expect along trails, but has too large of a scope to cover any one portion of the state in depth.If you are a long term resident and hiker in Virgina, this would be an interesting book to add to your collection as a reference. Do not buy this book if you are looking for pre-determined hike.

"Surprise! It's Really Good: Someone gave us this movie and it sat on our dresser for months because we didn't recognize the actors and we knew it was a Christian themed movie. We would love to support more ""family"" movies like this but usually the acting is very poor (Sorry Kirk!).Faith Like Potatoes was really good and engaging. I really wish it didn't have the ""Christian"" tag to it, because I think people are avoiding it for the reasons mentioned earlier. We watched it and decided we had to give it as gifts to others. It's a great movie with a good story, the fact that it's a true story makes it even more interesting.I'd highly recommend it Christian or not.

"The sweet disapearance of our heros.: We've all sat in the corner of our rooms mixing our sad, disapointing reality with the sweet melancholy of REM. With their new album ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi"" we are only that much closer to what we want to escape. Our heros have finally evaporated after the boil of comercialism and the loss of Bill Berry. After running in the ranks of Lost Shepard's, ""Farewell to Oakie"", they now join the huge army of uninspired alternative rock.

"Great DVD... if it was made by a 8th grader!: The only thing that saved this DVD from a single star rating was the fact that you can turn off your video and listen to the music. This is by far the worst proffesional production I've ever seen.Here is the idea... take some pretty cool voyager pictures of planets... cut them out and place them on a make believe star field. THEN super-impose cheep 3D renderings of the voyager spacecraft. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!That's not to say you won't be entertained... you'll get a good laugh. The most spectacular thing about this DVD is the number of people in the credits. One guy in his basement would have made sense...Seriously though, it would have made an excelent 8th grade video project.Please please please... save your money and buy a DVD that took more than a week to make.

"3 different Q phones, all dysfunctional: I today was dumb enough to pick up my 3rd Q phone in three weeks. My initial phone died on the charger the night I bought it. It went into some boot mode and never returned. It even puzzled the Motorola customer service to where they gave up. I picked up another phone thinking maybe I had a dud, and it worked great for two whole weeks, until the same thing happened again. I recognized it right away and took it to the store, versus wasting time with Motorola and the same helpless end result. So today I decided to give this phone one last hope and traded in another one. As I was pulling out of the parking lot of the store, it died and will only turn on if I remove the battery and replace it for each use. This phone is a disgrace to Motorola and the phone industry. How can someone market a product so unreliable and problem full. It is a pathetic excuse to compete in the industry and anyone affiliated with producing this phone should be disgraced.

"Used Book received in poor condition: I have ordered a few used books through Amazon.com and have had good luck with the purchase. This book I decided to try and when I received the book it was in really bad shape. It was not worth the price of a used book. I did not expect the book to be in perfect condition as it was being purchased used but I did not expect for the book to be filthy dirty and torn. It looked like it had been dropped several times on the floor and ran over by a fork truck or pallet truck. It will really makes me think twice before I purchase another used book. It might be worth paying the full price just so I can have a book that is readable. Everyone needs to think about ""Is the discounted price worth the trouble"". I would rate this purchase as very poor!

"An edge-of-your-seat psychological and action thriller: Harry Bosch is in his fourties and a temporarily suspended LAPD homicide officer when he decides to take on the most important case of his career: solving the more than 30 years old murder of his mother. Illegally using the name of his direct superior, who was the reason for his suspension in the first place, he takes the old file from the archives and starts his investigation. And apparently he is raking up quite some mud, because before long people start dying. And all the while Harry has to decide whether it is worthwhile what he is doing: will it help him to cope with the past?This book blends the description of a thorough and creative investigation with a lot of action plus an insight into the psychology of a man whose mother was killed when he was a teenager. One of the best of the Harry Bosch series of thrillers.

'08)I was compelled to pick up the 1st book and by the next day, I was clammoring for the rest of the series. The 2nd and 5th books of the series are very exciting. Not since I read The Gingerbread Kingdom, have I been captivated by a young adult fantasy book. One of my favorite things about these books are the detailed illustrations. Once I saw the troll from the 1st book, I just knew that along with a great story, I would also be treated to a feast for the eyes.Highly recommended!

"Spiritually Inspiring: Are you working 100+ hours a week? Feeling like something is missing in your life? No matter how hard you try or how much success you attain, you just don't feel complete. This book may be the beginning of your cure; if you are ready to hear its message and take it to heart.The book is a quick read which examines the religious histories of both the USA and the Bush family. From these contexts Mansfield reveals George W. Bush's spriritual awakening which occured late in his adult life and how this awakening has made him whole. As a spiritual biography of sorts, The Faith of George W. Bush illustrates that in his search for self fulfillment, Bush has found the answer which few seem to discover and fewer actually act on. What answer is that? Getting into heaven is more important than getting into Forbes.Also, we all have a soul which plays a much greater role in our big picture and sometimes due to the hectic pace we all lead; we neglect it to our overall detriment. Best Wishes.

"Obnoxious, fraudulent crap that insults on every level: How to describe how loathesome this film is? 60-something pursuing 30-something Hunt, despite the fact that her mother (Shirley Knight) is Nicholson's age? The pathetic gay character (Greg Kinnear, stealing Rupert Everett's Oscar nomination) who is beaten and seems to have no friends or lovers? The mugging of Cuba Gooding Jr.? The endless, winding plot that goes nowhere and never builds? Hunt, trying desperately to turn a single mother cliche into something real, despite her leaden commentaries about the HMO system? The ENDLESS cuts to the cute dog? The film's nasty, venomous ""humor"" coming from Nicholson, which is then tried to be covered up in ""Oh gee, isn't this awful"" backtracking? A completely vile film that inexplicably became a huge hit; everything in it is false, right down to Art Garfunkel's version of Monty Python's ""Always Look On the Bright Side of Life"" that cuts out the profanity (and the bite). Avoid like the plague.

"Sword of Shannara a 2 dimensional Ring Trilogy: I must say that I have been spoiled by Tolkien and Rowling. I just finished Sword of Shannara and found it VERY long winded. The style of writing is like James Fennimore Cooper (very wordy) with characters that are so two dimensional, that they border on one dimension. I had no idea why Shea would suddenly develop a spine, why Menion Leah was even likeable or that Balinor was any more than a blonde Ken doll with a sword. I am going to read book 2 to see if Terry Brooks has grown as an author. I hope so

"Hey man...: I love this CD! I put off buying it for a long time, either because I wanted something else or I didn't have any money. I had my doubts about it. Finally I got it and I love it. The songs are all different from a lot of the processed cheese on the radio today. Nelly's music is up beat with a world flavor. She blends different genres into one to make an impressive debut. I hope the radio stations play more of her music because it deserves to be heard by the general public. She has an interesting voice, but not Macy Gray interesting...Macy gray is just kind of...well you decide lol Give this album a try, it could open up new musical possibilities. Be open to new things and not get stuck in a rut that went out 10 years ago. If you only like one kind of music, your missing out. Be open.

"Only TWO Songs Make This Mandatory...: Ditto to ALL the negative comments you'll read from the other reviews here... but two songs make this a must-buy for any lover of Elaine Paige: ""You Must Love Me"" and ""Someone Else's Story"". And Thank God these are the only two songs where the orchestrations don't destroy the original melody. These songs ""complete"" the characters that Elaine originated on stage(especially for CHESS), and Elaine's vocals are just fine on both numbers. However, how she could destroy OTHER songs from shows she's appeared in(HAIR and SUNSET BOULEVARD in particular) is totally beyond comprehension. Outside an ""Andrew Sisters"" swing version of ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair"", I don't think you'll be listening to this CD more than once.

"KINDLE EDITION--DO NOT BUY--NO images referred to in the text: The book itself is thoroughly thought through. My negative review is not about the book itself, but about the Kindle Edition, which, for some poor reason, has NONE of the apparently copious visual illustrations referred to throughout the book. Lateral thinking requires the ability to visualize, so De Bono's conceptual framework and his intent to offer teaching exercises are thwarted by publishing the book with no images!There is, apparently, no way to return a Kindle edition for a refund, so I will purchase the paperback edition as I do want the book as a part of my visual problem-solving library of resources.

"Worthy read, looking forward to the sequel: I really give this one more like a 3.5 stars. I was drawn in by the author's voice, and that is mainly what kept me reading, as it connected me to the main character. Also, the strange use of verb tense. The writing switches back and forth between present tense and past tense--not different tenses for different scenes. Most of the scenes start in present tense and ease into past tense, and some switch back and forth a couple times within a scene. Oddly, I found it worked for me.The plot itself is rather mellow, but I never found it boring. I was a little disappointed that with the title being ""Witch Child"" it wasn't more...witchy. Mary does have powers, but there is almost no use of them. And the ending felt abrupt (that is what knocked this down from 4 stars to 3.5).That said. Worth the read. And I'm definitely interested in the sequel.

"Good Writing, Some Of It About Music Sort Of: Make no mistake: this is a Richard Meltzer anthology, not an anthology of music writing. It's a funny and fine autobiography, produced piecemeal through the various obscure journals that indulged Meltzer over the years.As for music, there doesn't seem to be anyone Meltzer even remotely likes, except for Jim Morrison, and I wish Meltzer had a less embarassing idol than that ""crooner in the rock mileau."" Also, I was annoyed with Meltzer's potshots at music writers who became bigger than he did, specifically, Bangs and Christgau. He did it before Bangs, Meltzer reminds the reader, as if Bangs didn't do it better. As for his criticism of Christgau, it's strange, to say the least, for Meltzer, who makes a point of NOT listening to anything he reviews, to accuse the Village Voice reviewer of not listening hard enough. Huh?Still, a fun book.

""Roam"" is a great song, but the problem here is that the remixes don't sound all that different from each other. It would have been more interesting if they some more radical remixing. Here is the track listing:1. Roam (7"" Remix)2. Roam (Radio Mix)3. Roam (12"" Remix)4. Bushfire (LP Version)5. Roam (Extended Remix)6. Roam (Instrumental)

"Do not purchase: I just ordered these beaters as a replacement for my Cuisnart CHM-7 hand mixer. The beaters are no where near the quality of the original beaters. The replacement beaters are lighter in weight, not the heavy duty stainless steel the original beaters are. Not only that, but they do not stay in the mixer which is the problem trying to be solved for. And it looks like they cannot be returned as they are considered an ""in touch with food' item. Extremely disappointing.

"...: this is the most disappointing item I have purchase from .... I must say it is flimsy to say the least. The phone has a tendency to drop out of it so be very CAREFUL!! I recommend spending $5-$10 more and get the leather case (which I have) it also allows you to rotate the phone for when you sit. This might seem odd, but the phone will not cut into your stomach while driving.

"This router died after 4 months!: Same problem as previous poster. One day I got home from work and only the power light was lit. No network activity lights. Tried to unplug for 30 seconds and plug back in. Tried the reset button. Could not log into router. It was dead. I've trusted Netgear product's for many years and this is by far the worst product I have ever purchased from them. I must say this router was by far the best router I have owned until it died randomly. However, due to the horrible product life I would definitely recommend not purchasing this router.

"Great underrated CD: Excerpt from CollegeMusicGuideMost of this recording is a set of duets by pianist Franck Amsallem and Tim Ries (on tenor, soprano, and flute). Leon Parker adds his minimalist drums to a few of the selections. With the exception of ""We'll Be Together Again,"" all of the music (which includes a few brief interludes along with full-length pieces) consists of originals by either Amsallem or Ries. Some of the pieces are free in spots, most are thoughtful and lyrical, and there is some heat generated in spots. In general, the improvising is subtle and finds the duo members reacting constantly to each other. Well worth a few listens.Scott Yanow

"Oregon Scientific Remote Weather Station: After 10 years, my old O/S weather station finally stopped responding to the outside transmitter.

"Rollins does justice to Baldwin: I'm reviewing the audio version of this novel after having read the unabridged version. Like the reader from Detroit, I was puzzled by some aspects of the audio abridgement (notably the conclusion), but unlike that reader I didn't think it detracted seriously from the flavor of what remained. I had doubts about whether an introspective writer like Baldwin could be a candidate for an audio book, but Howard Rollins made the text come alive. We can only be sorry he didn't record more of Baldwin's books, for Rollins' voice reveals the depth of his understanding of Baldwin's characters and emotions. There's a reason a book is considered a classic, and Rollins makes clear why this book has endured. Perhaps some listeners will be motivated by this recording to seek out and read Baldwin's other novels; if so, treasures await them.

"WWF/E Insurrextion 2002 review: The RVD-Eddie Guerrero-IC title rematch was just as good as their Backlash encounter even with the DQ ending. The Trish Stratus/Jacqueline-Molly Holly/Jazz tag team match was a hard-hitting/solid bout. The X-Pac-Bradshaw match was not great but pretty good and the same goes for the Booker T-Steven Richards-Hardcore title match. The tag team match between The Hardy Boys & the team of Brock Lesnar & Shawn Stasiak(What?)was so-so with pretty solid action. The Spike Dudley-William Regal-European title match was a fast-pace,hard-hitting bout. The match between The Big Show & Steve Austin while slow at times,it was still a entertaining,hard-hitting brawl and the same goes for the match between The Undertaker & HHH but that match was not slow to say the least. I give this event a 7 out of 10.

I felt stupid because I already did it once. So here's a better one (not to satisfy the poser that voted my review unhelpful mind you).This album is fu**ing amazing. It's darker than the first, I wouldn't say heavier or angrier but definitley darker. Great technical work on the drums by Joey, especially on Disasterpiece which is in my opinion the best song on the album.

"Working fine so far and does what it claims: So far I am very pleased with this product. I have read the negative reviews about it failing eventually but so far I have used it numerous times in a Big Green Egg for chicken and lamb roasts at grill temps around 350F with no problems. The remote functions well at a good distance and through an outside wall. I agree that the factory set doneness temps (that are unchangeable)are not ideal (as with most other digital meat thermometers). CONS: No timer built in and no way to set up a user defined temp alarm but I guess for under $30 what do you expect. Also will not tell you grill/oven temperature because max temp reading is only 199F.Look into the Maverick Et-73 for a remote dual temp (meat and grill) thermometer - but almost twice the price.

"I love Muddy... but Uggggh!: Like the title says, I love Muddy Waters. I also love hard screaming rock guitars. I love the blues, but am in no way a 'purist'. But this just doesn't cut it for any of those categories. Maybe it grows on you, but all I hear is constant distorted guitar ""wanking"". My advice is buy ANYTHING by Muddy before this, Hard Again or King of the Electric Blues are two if you like it loud and electric, Folk Singer and At Newport for just awesome blues. If you want psychedelic blues go for Cream, or Jimi, just anything else!

"Excellent for energy and appetite control: The product is great, and I'm sharing the royal jelly mix from YS Organic Bee Farms with my friends, who are also raving about it. The packaging was as shown, altho the 12000mg on the Amazon name is different from the 20000mg on the jar.I read about royal jelly in a Baring-Gould book which said Sherlock Holmes ""discovered"" Royal Jelly and considered it a ""fountain of youth"" and it made curious. So I ordered some, and did some research. There were some good reports about the benefits, some people consider it quackery. I know what I have experienced: I can skip breakfast with just a teaspoon of RJ and a cup of tea, not getting hungry until noon, which is unusual for me. The energy boost is smooth and sustained, unlike a jolt of caffeine or energy drink.I highly recommend it. I will try it more specifically soon, for defending against colds, etc.

"C.O.D. (or D.O.A.?): I'm a longtime Saint Vitus fan, but they took a serious nosedive with this. Don Dokken produced the album, but his presence was about the only high point here; he gives the band a more ""polished"" sound, but the material is about as dull and uninspired as it gets, which clearly shows that Vitus was going through the motions musically and on it's last legs--vocalist Scott Weinrich was replaced on this album by Christian Linderson, who is even more dull and boring, and imitates Weinrich almost to the point of parody.Vitus did a rearranged version of it's own ""Hallow's Victim"" by slowing it down and naming it ""Exhumed"" (they should've left it buried), and guitarist Dave Chandler called himself ""D.C. Vitus"" on the credits (no doubt an ode to M.C. Hammer?). My overall opinion is, stick with the Scott Reagers-era albums on SST and don't waste your time and money; this CD is out of print and probably will never see the light of day again, and for a good reason: it sucks!

"leave it in the past and move into the glow: I'm glad I heard Antique Glow before I heard the Past was Faster. If it had been the other way around, I might have not have even cared to go check out Antique Glow.This cd has a handful of gracious moments. The rest I would describe as Kelley sponging his influences and lacking the refinement/talent to wring out his own style. If you'd like to hear him in the beginning stages of discovering his own voice and laying down tracks that sound more like incomplete compositions, you may want to pick this up.I'd suggest Antique Glow instead of this album. On that album your palette won't be overwhelmed with the aromas of Robyn Hitchcock, Nick Drake, Syd Barrett, Beatles, Captain Beefheart, etc. like it will be here.

Justin did his thing and Nelly did his thing and it came out goodSo just back off of that and if you have a problem with that then don't listen to that track. the cd is still worth listening too. And i think it was a smart idea for Nelly to have justin on the track because justin can get cd sold just look at nsync last sales.

"Overall a VERY good buy!: As an owner of a Kirby, its no secret that the ""Kirby"" bags are not cheap. These bags are a fraction of the cost, and work just as well. The ""universal"" design of these bags to be used in a large number of Kirby Generations makes for only one slight annoyance, but in NO WAY a deal breaker...the notches on the intake inside the bag chamber, within the different Kirby Generations, are in different places. The unique structure of the removable carboard notches to fit the different Kirbys is great in theory, but they are not as easy to manuver. My G-6 fits the bags and I use them, but when initially putting a new bag on, it can be a bit harder to push it over the intake that some may like, but again, not a deal breaker for me. I will continue to buy these in the future and recommend them to my Kirby owning friends.

"Great album!: Great from start to finish. This is not the typical thin powermetal stuff that is getting so old nowadays. I think calling this powermetal is selling it short. This album has variety, deep songs instrumentally, time changes, awesome hooks, and tons of subtleties that set it apart. It feels like some passion went into writing this. Back Against the Wall is one of my favs and the first song I've wanted to crank as loud as possible in a long time. Highly recommended. This is a step back towards the excellent songwriting from Keepers. Buy it and encourage bands to really write music. I've been getting burned out on metal lately and this was a pleasant surprise.

"Presto Model 07300 electric skillet: Presto 07300 Stainless Steel Electric Skillet 12 inchPresto Model 07300 has poor heat distribution. The area above the heating element heats up within seconds, leaving the rest of the pan cool, especially in the center. After less than satisfactory fried eggs and pancakes, my husband filled the pan with 1/2 inch water to see what goes on. Even at a low setting of ""warm"", water boiled at one spot above the heating element. At 250, the water boiled nicely near the heating element, but nowhere else in the pan, even after ten minutes covered with the lid. Nine months later, after making do with the bad temperature distribution as best as I can, the plastic support structure broke near the center. That is the end of this skillet. I hope that others have better luck with it.

"Waterproof...until shredded: I bought this for a trip my wife was taking to Yellowstone this spring. It is big, and held our stroller, some luggage, and still had room for misc. stuff. Beware, there is no rigidity to it, and you have to stuff it like a garbage bag.The biggest problem was the quality. When my wife got back from her trip we found the carrier was shredded, and thread bare in many places. Everything in the carrier was wet.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who drives over 30mph.

"Mildy entertaining cautionary tale: This book was mildly entertaining. It was a little far fetch that the main character could go on such a downward spiral in such a short time. Research had some errors such as stating the house has a 4% edge on a basic strategy player. It is actually closer to 4/10 of a percent. A big difference.

"Confusing, difficult to follow plot: This is one of the few books that I have read to the end and am still not sure what actually happened. The author introduces and develops a plot line about freemasons and their political impact, only to have the plot line completely disappear. The book discusses a group of conspirators called The Three and later The Four and I am still not sure what they they were conspiring to do and why it required someone to fake their own death (in the middle of an assassination attempt on the president, no less!). I agree with an earlier reviewer who said that this is an unfinished book that was somehow published.

"Nice upgrade for a 2 cell AA Maglite !: If you already have a 2 AA cell mini Maglite in good condition, you might want to consider an upgrade to a new technology LED bulb, rather than buy a more expensive new LED flashlight.This bulb is rated at 100,000 hours life, is brighter, whiter and more uniform than the standard ""Edison"" bulb. Battery life is also improved, and the beam does not turn yellow as batteries wear down.Once past the ""sticker shock"", this bulb will save money in the long term, while providing a more useful light output.

"How frustrating!!!: Santa should have just brought an MP3 player, for that is all this is. I have spent days on this, and I still cannot download video files to it. What a waste of my time. I do not know why they would make it this difficult. And as far as the converting files...I wish someone could explain it to me. I went through the process, and it just tells me I can't convert because the files I downloaded are protected. I am ready to scream!! When I tried to call the support number, I got put on hold and hung up on three times. Then I got through, and guess what...they were closed. I can't imagine making a product that does not support a normal wmv file. Part of me wants to buy the clips just so my daughter can watch something on it, but I'm sooo angry, I don't want to put any more time, effort, or money into this product.

"good, but not as great as some people say...: This is a good rendition of Hamlet, with some breathtaking cinematography and decent acting. To be honest, though, Branagh simply did not work for me as Hamlet. Too old, too blond. Also, I don't know why he thought it would be a good idea to cast big-name American actors in minor parts--Robin Williams is kind of amusing as Osric, but most of them look glaringly out-of-place. On the plus side, Jacobi was typically briliant as Claudius (an intentional joke based on his starring role in the excellent I, Claudius?), and I absolutely *loved* the guy who played Fortinbras--talk about radiating menace! All in all, it's a worthy film, although at four bloody hours it's a bit of an endurance test. Also, it does not in fact feature the play's script in its entirety--I noticed at least one medium-sized speech that was conspicuous by its absense.What we *really* need is a Branagh King Lear. Now THAT could be really something...

"A Feast for the Eyes and Soul: I thoroughly enjoyed recently reading ""Oriental Belly Dance"". It gave a great history of belly dance in Turkey and a very enlightening overview of the meaning of belly dance to the people of Turkey. It focused on the sensuality of belly dance and gave a refreshingly simple message; women are sensual beings. Our bodies and sensuality are to be embraced, not hidden or feared. Belly dance is a celebration of womanhood and life! The photos of Turkish belly dancers new and old were a feast for the eyes! Great book!

"Not as advertised!: Shure markets this item as 5 pairs of identical replacement sleeves for the Shure E3c, E3g, E4c, E4g, E5c, I3, I4c, E3c-n and E4c-n model earphones. I own the E4c model, and since I've misplaced enough flex sleeves now so that I no longer had any working pairs, I decided to order this replacement pack. Sure enough, there were 10 clear flex sleeves in the package--but only 3 of them fit my headphones! The other 7 are too large to stay on my headphone nozzles, so they are useless to me. So basically I paid $13 for ONE pair of sleeves plus one spare (which happens to be somewhat useful as I did have one orphaned sleeve remaining from the original pack). Not worth it.

"Creepin on a classic!!!: Bone Thugs n Harmony's first album is as good as it gets. Off the streets no less then two weeks when they hit the studio, you can hear the raw agression in songs like Foe tha luv of $, and No Surrender. Thuggish Ruggish Bone was the song that first propelled bone into stardom, with the late great Eazy E producing, and DJ uneek laying the beats. Krayzie Bone lays down one of the best raps in Thuggish Ruggish Bone and the hook is memorable.The real hidden jewel on this album is the title track ""Creepin on a come up"". A song about how to survive on the streets really shows Bone at their most gangsta. That coupled with one of the best beats I've ever heard makes that song a classic. Krayzie Bone: ""Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t.""That line about sums up what bone was about.I definitly think this album, albeit short, was really as good as it gets in the rap game.

"Okay, But I've Used Better: I received this cookbook as a gift on my 22nd birthday--half my lifetime ago. It was okay for what it was--a place to start to learn everyday food preparation. However, as the years went by, I noticed that many of the recipes were rather bland; some of them were downright awful. I tried making brownies--they fell. I made some salad dressing--it was inedible glop. Many other dishes came away looking and/or tasting rather strange. At first I thought it was me, but many years and recipes and cookbooks later, I had to give ""Joy"" away. If you're new to cooking, this book is extremely useful. There's lots of background on cuts of meat and basic ingredients. An experienced cook might wish to purchase a less well-known and more creative volume.

"Alittle Disappointing: While I am a HUGE Katt fan this DVD was alittle disappointing. The constant repetition about the ""haters"" and looking out for yourself were annoying and were less and less funny as the show went on. The jokes/stories ARE funny but they are very few and far between in this show. Alot of good material seemed to have gone wasted and he was all over the place.Maybe I am being too critical and expect more but Katt seems to have gone backward from the ""The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 1"". Its follow-up ""American Hustle The Movie (aka Katt Williams: The Pimp Chronicles Pt. 2)"" was not as good as Pt. 1 and this DVD seems to have taken an even further step back.Katt seems to be preaching to the audience about the ""Haters"", Stand-Up should be Stand-Up and not a personal pulpit against the ""Haters"".

The balance between recipes, history and reminiscence was perfect, whether you're looking to relieve old memories or get a glimpse of the past before your time.The recipes were versatile, inexpensive and different than most of what I've seen in similarly themed books. The organization was good, everything was easy to read, and it was user-friendly all around. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.Probably the most unique thing about this book was the focus on nutrition; with some items in short supply compliments of wartime rationing, finding ways to balance nutritional needs was of paramount importance. This book includes many of the tips, tricks and ideas women used to ensure their families were getting properly balanced meals despite the lack of steak and other muscle meats.

Things happen that are just ignored, it seems like the plots are a pastiche of paragraphs about Scarpetta which are forced into a chronology by her editor.

"most impressive: I enjoy the Traditional Hawaiian music on this CD. Originally released 26 June 1972, this superb remaster of ""Young Hawaii Plays Old Hawaii"" is album No. 1 for the group Hui Ohana, writes Mr Bill Murata in the liner notes. It is astounding to me to read that ""none in the group has had any formal musical training. ""We learned music Hawaiian style"" -- from relatives at first then mostly self-taught. All three musicians are in their early twenties and at the begining of a musical career which continues more than thirty years after this album's release. Mr Dennis Pavao displays impressive vocal control on these songs, especially E LILIU E. Mr Nedward Kaapana plays a frimly planted bass in support of his twin brother, the now legendary Ledward Kaapana. Mr Led Kaapana already demonstrates an adept skill with hawaiian slack key guitar styles. If you are interested in the nascent stages of one of Hawaii's true living legends of their native music, this CD will interest you.

I was not surprised at all.It's a mixture of a few things, or maybe the books happened before these films, I don't know, nor do I particularly care: Underworld, the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings. I hate every single one of these franchises, so that fact that I detest Night Watch shouldn't come as a shock.The acting is stale, the music is so cliche it hurts, and the use of CGI is way over the top, as is usually the case with these mindless pieces of eye candy. (come on, a flipping, what looks like a, garbage truck? sorry, but no.)It also comes as no surprised that Tarantino's singing praise for this hill of cinematic retardation, on account of the fact that none of his films are nothing more than shallow, heartless, overstyilized pieces of eye candy with no soul.

"I'll ALWAYS stand by Celine's side.: I have been a Celine fan for over 10 years now,and my opinion of her has never changed....she has the best voice ever.But I'm not going to be biased about this cd.It is not her best effort...I don't feel her vocals are as strong as her previous albums which is a shame as she should be showing the world how amazing she is,however she shows she can use her lower range to her advantage.I'm pleased she chose to do a few up tempo songs...the woman can sing ANYTHING! I would have liked to have seen all new tracks instead of the two remixes.Celine is such an amazing talented singer that she shouldn't have to ""prove herself"" or try to impress by doing Britney-like songs.Celine you stand on your own,up there at the very top.I hope Celine will go on forever.

"Mine broke after 5 months: My coffee maker broke after 5 months. I was pouring the water in one morning and the water came straight out the bottom of the coffee maker. The only redeeming quality of the coffee maker at this point is that the other side didn't leak. I could still make coffee for breakfast.Another hassle is that you have to rinse the caraffe with warm and then hot water after filling the coffee maker or the thermos could break.

"Excellent Vendor!: Brite Star, the seller of this book, was by far, the best I've ever encountered on Amazon.Generally, it takes more than two weeks from the time I've ordered a book, to when I receive it.

And, the book was in better condition than stated.I will always try to use Brite Star in the future, and I urge you to do so as well.

"an attractive case: I bought this case because the case that came with my clarinet had very little storage space for accessories. This one has plenty of room, which is great. Don't expect to put your sheet music in here because it's not that big! I appreciate the shoulder strap which the original box did not have. My only complaint is that when I have the case open to put away my clarinet, it has a tendancy to flop shut which is very annoying. I have only had this case for 2 months, so I bet I will figure out exactly how to drape the shoulder strap behind the lid so it stays open but doesn't tip the whole thing backwards. I got the brown/black one. Love the way it looks. All in all, I am glad I got this case.

"Over-Engineered and it shows in the long run: My Rabbit worked well on the first couple dozen bottles of wine. My only complaint was (just as the manual said it might) that it was rarely able to grip the cork for easy removal from the drill. Apparently, bottles of wine under [money]uses slightly less fat corks so the Rabbit can't grip it. The design makes it very difficult to remove the pulled cork from the drill by hand. Very frustrating.Lately, the Rabbit works when it wants to. When it doesn't, it instead pushes the cork into the bottle.I've since gone back to my good old standy manual puller. It doesn't look as neat, but at least it works everytime.

"Questionable Methods.: Budd Hopkins, has spent many years working with people who feel that they may have been abducted by ""aliens"". During that time he has come to the theory that the ""aliens"" are using humanity for a cross-breeding program. He bases this on similar accounts involving procedures taking sperm and ova samples from many people in quite different sections of the country (U.S.A.)I feel that Mr. Hopkins truly wants to help these people, many of which seem to be suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder. I do however, question his strong reliance on hypnosis to recover these memories. Many studies recently have shown how easy it is for someone asking leading questions to a hypnotized person to inadvertantly imprint false memories.Not the best written book, but interesting. I do wish a little more scientific rigor had been followed by Mr. Hopkins in his investigations.

"Starting off on the wrong foot: Used this printer for a grand total of 2.5 business days (light duty) before it crapped out with the error code e225. Called customer support and waited on hold for quite a while only to be told that the unit can't be fixed without a technician for that error code. Options were to have a replacement mailed and return my unit, or take it into a repair center.Seriously, does anybody actually check these things before they go out the door? I know I'm working with a small sample size (1), but I can't help wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.For what it's worth, the machine worked great for the 5 print/copy/scans we did before it broke, but that would leave me with a $50 per use cost on the first machine and I don't think that's very attractive to most business users.

"AWESOME!: I purchased this dryer on sale at CVS. I love the cord keeper. I just hold onto the cord while it's retracting. The removable filter is much better than other dryers I've used, because there is a plastic piece that keeps lint from actually getting into the dryer. This dryer is much more powerful and lighter then any other dryer I've ever used. I have very thick coarse hair. With other dryers it took me 45 minutes to over and hour to blow dry my hair. This one dries my hair in 15 - 30 minutes. It leaves my hair looking and feeling fabulous. It gives my hair more volume and straightens my hair better than my other dryers. I still have to use a flatiron, but it only takes one pressing on each section instead of several to get it to lay flat.I strongly recommend this product.

"Worst Mousse EVER!: This mousse has got to be the worst mousse ever. I used it in order to get some control on my curls and to enhance my curls. I did not get either. This mousse made my hair an absolute mess! The curls I got were twisted together and not defined: my hair looked as though I had one big curl. Also, the mousse didn't offer much in the way of staying power so my hair became loose and what little curl I got did not stay around for long. Finally, this mousse does nothing to prevent frizz. After my hair dried it was rather frizzy and once I went outside my hair frizzed up even worse.The bottom line is that this product made my hair look REALLY BAD and it did not do one tenth of what it advertised.

"A Fanciful History of the Bible: If Campbell and Bell are to be believed then no important eventin the history of the Bible came until after theReformation. Comically, these authors can only refer to the Catholic Church as the ""important people"" when assigning it credit for deciding which books belonged in the Bible; although, Bell and Campbell are able to mention the Catholic Church by name when accusing it of adding books to the Bible at the Council of Trent. The Catholic Church did not add books at Trent and only reaffirmed their rightful place in Sacred Scripture.Campbell and Bell also error in claiming that the Roman Catholic Church broke away from the Orthodox Church. This is incorrect, and any dummy can easily reference the far wittier ""Complete Idiot's Guide to Biblical Mysteries"" in the same series to discover that the reverse is true.Bell and Campbell state in the foreward that they have written without bias.

Thanks to those who do this.The video quality was excellent, which is to be expected of any new movie on Blu-Ray. All new movies should look this good. The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was also excellent.This isn't a great movie, but it sure is neat.

"Will NEVER buy Calphalon Again - Safety Risk: THESE KNIVES ARE A HUGE SAFETY RISK.I will say that their knives are excellent, BUT the block DOES NOT accomodate the 6 steak knives included. They are meant to be ""kept in a drawer."" I don't know about you, but just keeping them uncovered (they do not have plastic sleeves available for them either) in a drawer is just asking for trouble. I called their customer service and they were less than helpful and said they would mail me some cardboard sleeves if they had some around. I have two children age 3 and under. I don't want to expose them to this risk, as well as any adult person who may want to get something out of the drawer. If you want to keep your family safe, don't buy.

"One sided: Seldom have I ever read a book that is so one-sided. ""All their fault"" mentality. I was looking forward to this book, but its a dissapointment. Its a non mea culpa. Its sad to see a person who can't come to grips with their failure. We read daily in the news how women are serving successfully in the US Air Force and US Navy. Many have served in combat. Including Miss Cummings contemporaries. Don't get me wrong, the book reads well, but its more like fiction than fact.As a woman in corporate America, I have faced virulent sexism. But when I see women succeed where other's fail, its hard to chaulk it up simply to sexism.This book was a dissapointment because it was so lopsided.

"The Revisionist Author Myth: This book ranks at the top of my list for books that never should have been written. It is painfully clear that Mosier is no historian. No military commander in history would reject executing an overwhelming assault if it were in his capability. Mosier states over and over that leaders on both sides failed to learn their lessons. Wars and even battles are evolutionary in nature and no one knows exactly how they will turn out. Using the author's logic, Mike Tyson's success in the boxing ring was not because he was more skilled or more powerful but because he had a political advantage.

"Not Inspiring at all!: Many movies have become very popular just based on the soundtrack composed for them. However, this soundtrack, was not very inspiring to listen to. I think that it may have even ruined the movie attached to it, The Alamo(2004),which was a flop of a film. I believe it made only about 25 million dollars WORLDWIDE, and yet Disney, the studio which made the film, was boasting before it was released, that it cost over 100 million dollars to make! OK, but for all that money, one would have thought that at the very least, the Alamo compound could have been made correctly! But the soundtrack was no better, and why every Alamo soundtrack has to have Celtic/Scottish themes is way beyond me. Further more, the music did not have any catchie tunes, not even the battle music was any good. However, for an Alamo buff, the music was sent down from Heaven. Ok.................!

"Don't miss this one!: This was the first Vonnegut book I ever read, and it's still perhaps my favorite. His unique genius truly shines in this novel as you are pulled along most willingly through the realm of both the impossible and unthinkable. Each character is vivid and lives on in your mind well after you've put the book down. Of course, actually putting the book down is a challenge. Even when you've finished, you'll want to read it again from end to beginning and look for hidden messages, because you know your own imagination is not nearly vast enough to have captured the seemingly endless facets of this story. Don't die before you read Cat's Cradle, because this is at least one more thing you need to do before you've led a full life.

"I Marvel that I Managed to Finish This Book: Most of this book was pointless fluff. Why do we need to know every detail about the main character's teaching and his marriage and blah blah blah? The few chapters with Claire in the beginning were not enough to convince me of a great love -- and the reason for their (prolonged) seperation didn't convince me either, so nothing in-between held me. At many points I wondered what I was reading for. He seemed obsessed, she seemed morose -- I didn't care one way or the other by the end. And I'm a romantic!!!

"Fast, fun and fabulous: BeadWork has created a number of these slim books with tempting pictures and tightly edited instructions. With Beaded Beads, even the beginning beader can have a lot of fun creating usable pieces in a short time.Jean Campbell deserves a lot of credit for keeping the information to just the facts. Occasionally, one more diagram would be useful, but I'm a slow learner without lots of pictures. The beginner should know that there are two help sections in the back of the book--'Tips' and 'Stitches'.The sections are a real plus. With these instructions, even a novice bead addict can produce the beads shown, and advanced beaders can move on from these instructions to create their own work.New projects start on the right page, with the glorious picture on the left. Great layout, type you can read, and a wide variety of projects make this a book you need for your studio. Only change I'd make it to wire-bind the book so that it lies flat when in use. --Q

"Punk Done Right: Deep Elm is one of the best record labels around. They routinely offer promo cds for a penny (!!!) containing many new bands, and they certainly did themselves right signing these guys. To me, they sound like a hybrid cross of early Hot Water Music (especially concerning the vocals) and under the radar era Grade. And this is a very good thing. Their lead single ""Doom! Doom! Doom!"" plays like you're standing admist a mass of bouncing bodies in a club, and you can almost see the lead singer shredding his voice, spittle flying everywhere. The album is very raw, but satisfyingly so. It is electric, and sparks with energy in spades. But above all, it feels very honest. There is nothing particluarly novel about the album, but there are no pretentions either. It is intensely catchy and enjoyable punk, that is just edgy enough to stay off of most people's radar...but you would do very well to pick this up and give it a spin.

"It's time to kiss $200 (and Litter Maid) goodbye.: We bought one and it seemed to do the job so after a week we bought a second one. BIG MISTAKE.One machine broke and the rake just flopped around and couldn't scoop. We were able to get a replacement - but it is still in the carton - because the other litter box is always jamming. And they sent the wrong model (a cheaper one).One of our three cats tends to pee on one side of the box and the clump is getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. We can only imagine that the urine goes down the side of the pan, under the litter, and then clumps and sticks - constantly. We tried EVERY recommendation in reviews to try and stop the sticking.I will give the replacement box away and throw away the used one. Maybe the next owner's cat will pee right in the middle.It's back to the old-fangled poop and scoop box.

"Dissapointing Purchase: At the bookstore, I was seduced by the graphics and the concept of the book. The world really needs a book like this. The concept of incorporating css and graphic design as one creature is really pertinant.However, the book was watered down and poorly organized. It takes designs from the website and discusses parts of them. I found this piecemeal approach really difficult to understand. A little code here, a little design there but never enough to provide a solid context.It also tried to cover too much ground, and as a result it didn't go into enough depth to be of any use.This was a pretty expensive book (at the book store it was about $40), and I found it almost a complete waste of money. Buy something better, such as Styln' With CSS.

"So Lemony Snicket is a real person?: The first question that popped into my head was ""Is Lemony Snicket a real name or a pseudonym?"" The second was ""How would she sustain the misfortunes and make it a believable story?"" The first one is yet unanswered but the second became clear when I read ""The Bad Beginning."" Without the series title and the warning blurb, this is just your run-of-the-mill children's book. It thrives on conflicts that are mandatory anyway in any fictional work, and pretends that this banality is what makes it unique. Finally, when things seem to have been resolved towards the end, the villain escapes. Did anybody say, ""Scam""? It reads to me like the starting paragraph of the next book in the series. True enough, there have been at least ten books released.I would recommend you wait for the movie. This concept may be more successful in the cinematic form, and it would be a chance to see Jim Carrey monkey up again. As for the book, well, it's well-bound, but only literally.

"Rock and Roll Paddy: ""A drink with Shane MacGowan"" is a series of recorded interviews with Shane by longtime girlfriend Victoria Clarke. It is an interesting approach and Victoria gets Shane to open up in ways the media, of course, would be unable to. The beginning of the London punk scene, family, drugs/drink, racism, religion, authors, the end of the Pogues and his life's philosophy are just a few of the many topics covered by Shane and Victoria. Also included are some handwritten songs and drawings which were a cool touch and greatly contribute to the book. The only downside to this book was Victoria's overdone, heavy handed (and self complimentary) chapter introductions. But these will be easily forgiven, for this is a fascinating conversation with an amazing songwriter. Definitely recommended for any music, Pogues/Popes or punk fans.

"Not suitable for children under 13!: To reply to another user that asked if it was suitable for a 10 year old kid, I would have to say no. Although the characters used in the movie are around that age, the lanuage used will offend you children, aswell as adults. It does not add to the story, and the language is used often.The book on the other hand is very clean, and has no bad words. I would recommend reading your son the book. Not only does it not have bad language, it also covers more information, and has more symbols. The pig's head talking is a major point in the book, and is completely removed from the movie...Hollywood has taken a book written by a Nobel Prize winning author (Sir William Golding), and has beaten it until it was dead. I would recommend you read the book before watching the movie, so that you know what it should really be like.

But sometimes-- and Scavenger is one of them-- it pays to dump a loser and try something new. Scavenger is easy reading and the beginning of the book shows some promise. However, soon the plot seems rather flawed and the character's motivations appear contrived-- a flimsy excuse for the character to continue his hunt.

After following the instructions ""verbatim"" I read a little note that said that after heating up you might see flames start coming through the meshing, if this happens shut off propane with the valve on the unit. You're thinking what are the odds of that happening?? Well it's not astronomical, because guess what, it happened. Although it didn't happened during the preheat, it happened while I was using the unit. So, after putting down and waiting (the book says it will stop when the excess insecticide is burnt out) I started to see black smoke (aka plastic burning) I quickly disengaged the propane tank. I went and got my neighbor (because I didn't have a fire extinguisher or water hose) by then it was engulfed in flames and doused that thing. I know this may not be the norm but that is a serious safety issue that needs to be addressed. Buyer take care when using!!

If you have this problem, lay it on a flat surface and use a blow dryer on it. The edges will slowly return to their proper shape, but don't let it get too hot - heat will damage it easily.

"Micro pocket scale: It is totally inaurate, does not work correctly, is very small and unusable. It is not as described in the details to order. I wanted a small (thin) scale with a large weigh surface. This is not as described. I have never used it because of the gross inaccuracy. It will not weigh coins as it states.

"Long Life!: I have almost the same watch, except that I purchased it a good 15 years ago. Although I have not treated it well, it has rewarded me with a long life and excellent performance. It keeps perfect time, so I only reset it at the beginning and end of Daylight Savings Time or when I go to a different time zone (which is rare). A few years ago, I thought it needed to be repaired. I took the watch to the watch repair shop, and they informed me that it only needed a new battery. They were right. Other than the occasional band cleaning, that is the extent of the maintenance this watch has required for 15 years.My only disappointment is that, like a another reviewer mentioned, Wenger has changed the model to a white face. I prefer the black face that I have, now. It just looks better with the steel (white looks better with either gold or something dark). So, I knocked off a star for appearance (only). For performance, this guy gets five stars and then some.

"A secular Hollywood movie about religion? Please.: Lets go see this movie because Orlando Blooms in it!Please Hollywood. This movie is so off it's not even funny. They do everything they can not to offend anyone. Blooms character would be seen as an infidel. He also does not become a great fighter after 5 minutes of lessons from his father. He says he has no religion, so why even go to Jerusalem?A fiction movie to attract Orlando Bloom fans all for the $$$$$. It's not bad but it's not accurate either. It takes place long ago with todays politically correct thoughts. Stick with the History Channels look at the Crusades for educating. Watch this to be entertained.

"Japanvisitor.com: Essential reading for anyone even remotely interested in Japan's incredibly sophisticated food culture. This pocket-sized book is crammed with useful information both practical and historical, not merely chronicling recommended restaurants (it does that too), but seeking to explain the culture through the cuisine. Its chapters cover staples and specialities; drinks and drinking; home cooking and traditions; foreign infusion; celebrating with food; regional variations; shopping & markets; where to eat and drink; understanding the menu; a Japanese banquet; fit & healthy; and the culture of Japanese cuisine. The concluding bilingual glossary is particularly useful, for first-time visitor and Old Japan hand alike. Ashburne's writing is fun, almost irreverent, and the research (as one might expect with an LP title) is highly detailed; the definition of the origin of Tempura is the most complete that this reviewer has ever encountered. It made me laugh too. Highly recommended.

"Powerpoint: I love this device--so much so that I keep trying to find a way to make it work.

This makes the device completely useless in presenter mode, something I am unable to do without because of the uses that typically precede my own presentation. This makes the device, which is wonderfully built and designed, useless for me at this time.

"A little funky romanization.: Sadly, I cannot give this book a nice review.Jane Wightwick et al produce some excellent Arabic instruction books, but this simple chinese vocab book seems to have fallen through the cracks.It does little to provide more than rote memerization of the characters, but really falls short on the romanization. Not only is pining not used or mentioned, the entire notion of Chinese being a tonal language isn't even mentioned! So you get words like ""ya-ds"" or ""ger-bou"" and thats all you get. Which is useless without tonal information.It may be worth the low price to use the flash cards alone, but that's about all.

"Truly LOST!!!!!!!!: I had a lot of hope for this book when I started. With the cover art and the description, I expected something more along thelines of a ghost story with literary connections, etc. Well, lets just say this piece of ""work"" does not know where it is going. The ghost story I was hoping for was incomplete and garbled. And what is the point of the whole Scrooge storyline?Maguire could have just as easily left Scrooge out of it and it wouldn't effect the plot a whole lot. I guess Maguire just has to have some literary gimmick.I was left scratching my head at the end of it. I felt a little cheated or perhaps more accurately, mislead.

"Reality Check: I am sooo sick of people bashing Scientology, saying it's a cult or whatever else they makeup.I read this book, Fundamentals of Thought, and had for the first time in my life felt that finally, someone had some concrete information on how life works.AS I was reading it, I was told by other people who were not Scientologists about how 'bad' it all is and thus my viewpoint was a little blurred by there lies. Finally, I asked myself whether or not I wanted the truth or a bunch of BS.Fundamentals of Thought is amazing. It's unbelievably logical and doesn't go in circle like some philosophers do.It gets to the point, and by god, it hits stuff on the nail.

"Bum Rhapsody--I got duped!: Rhapsody:I have to agree with David DeLucia: ""From the 18th on he pretty much leads the field."" However, from the intro to XVII, it's rather boring music making that does not make a whole lot of musical sense and really doesn't convey the message of a rhapsody--it doesn't really convey any message other than, ""I can play all the notes.""I had reservations about acquiring this cd set because it seemed odd to me that Hough would perform these works and, even worse, record them. He extended himself beyond his normal scope--he should not take on music beyond the style of Saint-Saens (exception maybe the Liebermann Concerti) where Hough has arguably few peers. I liken this to the idea of Perahia playing Rachmaninov, Arenky, Shostakovich, Medtner, Prokofiev, or to a middleclass boxer jumping up to the heavyweight division. It just doesn't work. Don't get me wrong, Hough is the Middleweight champ!!Mr. A offers solid alternatives to this set.Piano Concerto #3 review TBA

"A Champion's View on a Champion's Life: 'The Hurricane' was one of the best films I have seen. And for a film to make me want to read it's extra special. 'The Sixteenth Round' is extremely well writen, because no one can write a champion's life story better than himself. The story of Rubin Carter caught my attention when I was researching into my sport's history. As a Junior Welsh Amateur Champion myself I can understand what being on top really feels like, to have to watch every little thing you do incase something can be used against you in the future. This book has inpired me to learn even more about Rubin Carter. After reading this book I felt like I knew Mr. Carter and wanted to help him somehow. My wish is to meet, my hero, Mr. Carter.

"Not One of My Favorites: You don't need me to tell the you the story in this, the third of her stories about the life and loves the Gallagher siblings. That has been done very well by the other reviewers. I just want to add to the reviews by saying that, as a Nora Roberts fan, this one was one of my least favorites. The first book of this trilogy captured my imagination with the use of the ghosts and legend and their impact on the main charaters' lives, but with each of the successive books, the story got weaker and weaker. I can't get a handle on my dismay with this book, but suffice it to say that when I finished, all I could say was to my friends and fellow romance readers, ""Oh well -- whatever."" Not my usual, ""you've gotta buy this one!"" Trust me, you can wait to borrow it from a friend.

If you're looking for practice exams: move on, look at another product because this isn't it. Their practice test contains 65 questions, that's it. Oh, there's a teaser to purchase more questions but 296 isn't on their list.IMHO, this book isn't for an in-depth review of areas that might crop up in the 296 test.

"The Killer in Me: This is a fast-paced swirling vortex of a novel-I finished it in one night. The story concerns Harold Odom, a confused young man drowning in his own circumstances: Depression-era poverty, serious Oedipal/sexual confusion, a neurotic alcoholic mother, sensitivity and repressed rage, along with the Brooklyn mobsters who make him one of their own, with tragic results. Charles Perry manages to portray Harold's complex nature--his vulnerability and his violence--in a keen and convincing manner. The wise-guy dialogue is sharp and never hackneyed, and the stream-of-consciousness narration pulls you into the mind of Harold from beginning to end. The characters and settings are realistic yet electric, like film noir but with more of a troubled heart. A great read, through and through.

"Not like the old Veggie Tales: I have a collection of Veggie tales dating back to the earliest ones made. A few years ago, the producers sold rights to one of the networks. This latest one is a product of the 'after' effects of that relationship. The story line is much darker than you would normally expect from veggie tales. You really don't get the message about true beauty at all because most of the talk and action is done between the queen and the mirror who wants to 'finish' the local maiden. My almost 4 year old was scared and also the other day said, ""I don't feel pretty"" - she's never said anything like that in her life. I asked her why she was saying that and she said because of the queen in veggie tales. I promptly through the thing in the trash - don't buy this - it's just confusing and not a good wholesome presentation of true beauty. Shame on veggie tales!

I think Graywolf better go back to printing the books they used to print instead of all this name-dropping. And the author's new book, an anthology, is just the same. An anthology that's all about the person who edited it! Wow, how interesting. It's as if all the other wirters who are in the anthology are just nick nacks for his amusement.

"Depends on what you like: I can see the points of those that don't like it and of course I see the side that likes it. This is a sometimes brilliant, sometimes spacey, sometimes jazzy, and sometimes silly album. But, it is always great music to these ears. Listening right now to the female space vocals similar to a Gong album, then right into an intense march beat with Hammond organ. Awesome. I give it 4 stars as it can get a little dragged down but not for long. The Rotters Club is a 5 star effort, they perfected it for the second album.Phil Miller the guitar player is different than most I have heard and he is masterful. Richard Sinclair on bass, has jazz licks and a top notch voice, some great exchanges with Miller. Pip Pyle is one of the top 5 drummers in prog rock, damn he is good. Dave Stewart on keyboards and I suspect the musical direction is a master of his craft as well. If you like 70's mellow prog, you will dig this.

"We have a shark problem here!: This movie is absolutely spectacular! When I was 10 years old I first watched it and I loved it since then! I got this special VHS edition of it and it is excellent. Excellent sound, picture! The making of it and theatrical trailers are cool too. I recommend everybody to get this video for their collection! It is worth it!

"The Wrath of a Warg: This is an awesome toy! The warg rider Sharku is pretty neat. Some problems are that it is very difficult to position him on the warg. Also he isn't very durable. One time my sister took him and sqeezed him between the couch. When I found him his left hand broke off. Anyways Sharku is highly detailed and looks as ugly as he does in the movie. He also has leg moving and sword swinging action. The warg is really awesome. It is extremely detailed and almost fully possable. It has jaw-chomping action. The warg's head is covered in rubber so when its jaw chomps it looks really realistic.It also has a rubber tail and mane. The jaw is filled with teeth and is sticking out its tongue. This is a fantastic toy.

"This movie is AWFUL!: I saw this piece of junk on DVD and fell asleep through half of it. First of all where did they put the 40k, all I saw was some stupid fake blood with a loser's tongue WHICH WAS NOT SCARY AT ALL! And that was it, that was what you could actually call a special effect although it's a lot worse. This movie is sooo boring. It'll make your head spin the camcorder is so shaky and stupid. All's your watching is 3 losers walking around cursing. And where are all the scary parts there were none. If your a normal person you won't buy this it's probably the best way to waste money. VERY BAD MOVIE!

"EXCELLENT FILM!!!: You will not be disappointed with this film! I give it a 10/10, 5 out of 5 stars, 2 thumbs up. It's a great poker film and an excellent film overall. The acting is far superior than any big blockbuster in years. The plot line and story flows well, with all the characters meeting at the final table. The sub plots aren't cheesy and are true to life. I can not think of a better film I've seen in the past 10 years. Too bad this was only a limited release.

"A modern fairy tale.: A fairy tale for the latter half of the 20th century, I bought this as I remembered how charming it was as a science fantasy fable and for its (at the time) leading edge use of CGI for the starship effects.

I always knew that it wasen't good to use your fingernails, and I knew I needed to stop. I bought this tool and it works great. Of course it isn't going to be able to target the TINY blackheads but it will get some of the bigger ones.

"One Night with the King: I didn't like this movie really. It was almost typical of what hollywood does when they either don't have the facts as to the events they are using as a basis for the movie, or they prefer to change it according to their belief system. Believe me, the bible account is quite exciting enough. I am particularly fond of this account for oh so many reasons. I noticed that this was popular, and without really paying attention to the product notes, I got sucked into looking at it. I would only recommend others see this movie to compare with another to see the difference. The problem is, when you see the other (as there are a number of these movies out there), you really don't want to revisit this one again.

"NO HEAT IN THIS ONE: Hampered by sophomoric special effects, a limp script and an uninspired cast, COMBUSTION is a disappointment. Joe Lando (Dr. Quinn) stars as a city engineer who believes deadly gases are somehow being released into the city's underground sewer system, resulting in deadly fires and deaths. Greeted with skepticism by the egotistical fire chief (Michael Gregory, overacting shamefully), Lando must convince the mayor and everyone that he is right. Of course, a greedy oil baron (Michael Gross, looking woefully embarrassed) is the one responsible for the gas releases, but he doesn't want Lando to uncover this. A subplot involves Lando's troubled marriage to Gabrielle Carteris and their son's involvement with the daughter of Lando's old flame, who is now a newscaster(Susan Walters). Directed with little regard for common sense or pacing, COMBUSTION fizzles instead of sizzles.

"Very Good Bond Game for DS: I DO NOT care what other people think about this game. This is a fun game that will last a very long if you have friends who also have a DS so you can link up and battle each other. The graphics are great for a small hand-held console. Its sort of difficult to shoot your right hand weapon because you have to aim with your stylus and you don't have a finger to press the R key except for you pinky. Overall, I think it is a very fun and challenging game. I recomend this game to anyone who is a fan or likes James Bond games.

"Edwardian drivel: I will concede two things to this novel: The author had me fooled and despite a terrible opening, I wanted to know what happened, but this book doesn't know what it is: not quite a Victorian gothic romance, nor a geopolitical thriller, it was hardly at all informative on the historic events leading up to the Great War, and the baronet was essentially wooden, as if that was enough to fool the English and Germans around him that he was one man or the other. I do not mind reading for light entertainment, but there were too many highly improbable threads, not enough plot, nor full fledged characters facing real moral conflicts. It is worse than modern pulp fiction.

"Missing Toy Story short: For people who already own all Pixar Blu-rays, this contains very little new material, namely:- Up short: George & A. J.- Toy Story short: Small Fry- Cars shorts: Air Mater, Time Travel Mater- 7 student films""Small Fry"" is an absolute hoot, just perfect - while the others are so-so.Still, such a release would be a nice thing for Pixar completists like me. Emphasis on ""would"".You see, this collection is not complete at all, because it omits the third Toy Story short, ""Partysaurus Rex"", which was shown in theatres along with the 3D version of ""Finding Nemo"" this summer. Why this short isn't included is just baffling. To top it off, ""Partysaurus Rex"" won't even be on the upcoming ""Finding Nemo"" Blu-ray.So, two stars. One for this set being incomplete, and another for the brilliance which is ""Small Fry"".

"Salvatore at his best: Salvatore has done it again in the third book of the Icewind Dale Trilogy. Entreri, intrigued by Drizzt and wanting to prove that his moral code is the better, that by losing his goodness and bringing his body under absolute control, by honing his muscles to their finest fighting edge to the exclusion of all else, he has become a pure fighter, undefeatable. So he takes Regis and draws Drizzt into a fight he cannot avoid. I think, the most compelling thing about Salvatore's books is his beginning of section musings, a probe into the honorable and wise mind of Drizzt Do'Urden. And in his writing it is apparent that he sees these characters as more than just words on a page, he has done a masterful job of making us see the same thing. For breathing life into a book I will never tire of reading, I thank you, R.A. Salvatore. Nathan Jones

"Inadequate size and suction: My long hair has caused clogs in the shower on more than one occasion, so we set out to find the perfect drain cover. This item did not succeed for us. As others have mentioned, the diameter was too small for our two standard shower drains (the 5"" measurement listed is the outside edges, not the size of drain it covers), so the suction areas overlap the drain edge and won't hold. This leaves the cover to slip around from a nudge of the foot or a direct hit from the shower flow. When it actually stays in place for a few minutes it will catch some hair, but not enough--we still got a clogged drain from the hair that slipped past. The positives I can mention are the fact that you get two covers in the pack and the covers are soft and squishy, so they do not get broken or hurt your foot if you accidently step on them. But we are still on the hunt for a good drain cover.

We have also received some concerns from buyers that the subject matter may be inappropriate for children of this age-group.

The book is just so-so and tends to over glamorize someone who is not perhaps the best role model for young girls to have. I believe they are better women out there who are a much more worthy subject for a series called Women of Achievement.

When the TKKG Detectives (the four young people) discover a hidden cave filled with excitement and thrill they also stumble onto the answer to a question of legendary proportions and it is absolutely wonderful to watch. The film is refreshing and unlike most films of today, an actual breath of fresh air! The film is dubbed in English so the spoken words do not always match the mouths of the actors however it is not distracting to most people I've met or to me, and I have watched the movie 77 times and am still planning to watch it more. For me this film goes right up there with legends like John Wayne films and Double Dragons. I would strongly recommend watching it!!!!!!!!!!

I just wanted something solid. I had a good umbrella that lasted me 12 years, and then I lost it. I wanted to replace it. That's the GustBuster market -- people who take the time to look around, who are willing to pay more, and who want quality.It seems crazy to cut corners on the handle to save a buck. They should build it right and raise the price.Until they do, buyer beware.

"Horrible Quality Control: Up until recently, I had been using his food exclusively, but after several disturbing incidents I have switched brands. In the last few months have found cardboard, hair, and a bug in three separate varieties of Merrick dog and cat food. When I found the cardboard, I contacted the company with my findings and they apologized and mailed me a coupon. Since then, I have found hair in two varieties of dog food and the final straw last week was opening a can of cat food to find a dead fly right on the top of the food. There is no way that this food is being produced in a human facility. The quality is appalling -- especially at these prices. I have spent thousands on Merrick pet foods, but they have lost my business forever.

"Good fun book for cyberpunk fans: This the first book of Pat Cadigan's I've read. I can't remember who or where I heard about it, but a good book.The novel is set in a near future cyberpunk world where artifcial reality (AR) is commonplace and people regularly fall into lives in AR that are more compelling that lives in the real world. The technology is believeable with enough details to satisfy hard sci-fi readers without delving into textbookese.Having enjoyed the proto-ARs that are online games, I was interested in seeing what Ms. Cadigan had to say about the future.Similiar to Gibson's Pattern Recognition, all the characters in the book are looking for something. The focus is on the role of artifical reality in these hunts. The vision is interesting, but in the end it is difficult to relate to reality.The book is fun and enjoyable as a quick read, but for more heady cyberpunk, turn to Bruce Sterling.

"At most a good scrub: At most this is a good scrub. After using it, I feel that my skin is squeaky clean. But it doesn't do anything deeper for the skin at all, as in I still get pimples and my pores are still clogged. Perhaps my skin needs more drastic help. This is simply too mild to be of much good. After a while, it was too much effort for not much result. You have to scrub for about one minute and then apply the second solution. There's also the risk that one will run out before the other.

"Form over function: I was looking for just such a product to stick to the underside of my kitchen sink and illuminate the corner cupboard. I thought it was a bit expensive--costing about three times as much as similar, generic products--and it turns out I was right. The Dot-It provides hardly any light at all. It sticks fine, and it turns on and off fine, and it's cute, but it can't even adequately light up the inside of a small cupboard. I definitely will not buy another.

"Excellent pairing knife: I don't use this little guy every day but when I do need a small knife I love it. Fits my hand perfectly, insanely sharp. Just a beautiful excellent knife. I'd highly recommend any Shun knife to anyone if they can afford them. They are expensive but you are buying superior quality. Well worth it.

"Q:How good do you think it's gonna' be? A: Better still!: I have been reading a lot of reviews from people who have not played this game yet. They are already giving it outstanding reviews based only on still images or short previews.Those samplings do not do this game justice. It is all that you think it is going to be and more! Nothing short of outstanding!Everything from the atmosphere to the basics of the game play are phenomenal. The visual and auditory definition are a great testament to what the XBox is capable of. The detail in 5.1 Surround blew me away!

"Eh...: I suppose I would give it a 2.5 if I could. It was moody and descriptive but...well, not much else. I didn't feel invested in the characters, so I was just sort of along for the ride. Didn't help that there were far too many bugs!! lol I wanted to like it since I have read other books with similar settings that I loved, but this was just so so...

"Slow & Overloaded Website, cannot cancel: Website is slow and overloaded. Sometimes takes minutes to get into site or to get an article to load up (this on a high-speed connection). WSJ always claims that it's a problem on my end, even though all other sites I go to load up in 2 seconds or less.Also, they go up on charges without warning. My original subscription was $29. Now it's $79, but they never warned that the charge was going to $79; they just charged my credit card.

"Wrong impression, this is Shia not sunni!: I wish really that Mr. Richardson would re-study his opinion of Islam. he is referring to the teaching of Shia Muslims, not that of the Sunni....He needs to be more specific. As a Sunni, I am offended. A very uniformed author.
