"Read the screenplay instead - it has more depth: Not much to say about this novelization. It offers little beyond the screenplay and actually changes some of the most entertaining dialog.

"Terrible swing: This swing could barely move with just the car seat in it and wouldn't move at all with the baby in the car seat. Forget about it if you have other kids running around the house as well, it's the perfect height for little hands to poke the baby!

"Poor writing causes the show to drag: As a household of sci-fi fans, we tried several times to get into this show. but it is incredibly boring, despite the potential. Nothing ever seems to happen. There's no suspense, no surprise, no twists, nothing scratches the surface. Their attempts at plot twists are ho-hum, and I've never once found myself thinking ""I wonder what will happen next?"" because I know that every time I tune in, three things will be true: 1) The Visitors are evil (blatantly so; no shades of gray here), 2) They're trying to lull humanity into a false sense of security, and 3) There is a resistance. Everything else just feels like it was thrown in to have something happen, but it really doesn't have any relevance to what's going on.The acting is pretty good but you really can't connect with any of the characters. There's nothing there to relate to, nothing to grab you and suck you in.

"not for kids due to nudity: This is more like a complaint. I was shocked to see lewd scenes/nudity in this series. I wanted to present this dvd set to kid. I changed my mind. The whole presentation of this series looks like for dimwits who haven't gone to school in their entire life or can't make efforts to read better movie-making books. The duration of this series is too long. There are few tips about movie-making that can be covered in a 4 page blog with demo videos. Borrow/Rent it before you buy it.

"The Living End: The Living End brings together all the best elements of rock and punk music to make a fast paced, exciting experience. They have an excellent mastery of the instraments that they play, more so than many other bands out there. They are the biggest band out of Austrailia since AC/DC, and they're just as good or better. I was never a fan of hard rock and punck music but this band is an exception. They are original and refreshing.

"Advertising Mishap?: The Amazon description, as well as the cover of the box, state this chair can be used on a 6"" depth table with skirting. The manual of the chair states a 4"" depth, while the label on the chair itself states ""no more than 1.5"" thick""...so what to believe. Well, it didn't work on my 6"" table and it's way too bulky of a chair to use on my island, so I returned it and purchased the Graco chair for the same price. Also, I was dissapointed that the Chicco chair has a flimsy seat bottom. My 6mos old didn't even look comfortable. The Graco is a stiff chair and much more user friendly, not to mention easy to clean w/o taking everyting apart to toss in the washer. While the chair was easily returned/refunded, I don't recommned this purchase.

"Very good sprayer; tedious cleanup: Highly recommended sprayer. The sprayer, once you get it going, is very good at distributing paint evenly and quickly. The organization of the Owner's Manual, however, is another matter. The Owner's Manual is hard to follow. The cleanup procedure, as described in the manual, is tedious but necessary if you want the sprayer to work next time you need it. Make sure you follow all the cleanup steps including the oil in the Inlet/Outlet Valves. After a couple of iterations you get the hang of the process and everything goes much more smoothly. A rewrite of the manual would make this an excellent product.

"A must-have for anyone trying to understand socio-economic class in the U.S.: Like ""Framework for Understanding Poverty"" this book was a paradigm-shifter for me. All the cliches apply: it opened my eyes, i see things more clearly, etc. It helps you understand the dynamics at play between working class, blue collar and white collar environments. This is a great book and the ideas are so intuitive and ""click"" so clearly, that you will be thinking about it for years to come. Cannot say enough good things about it.

"Remix Disaster: This was my favorite album back in the days of cassette tapes. I wish I still had the tape. It would be better than the remixed garbage put out on CD. Why would anybody want to take a perfectly good drum track and make it sound like a casio drum machine on PURPOSE? The original Tejas was one of those rare albums where EVERY song was good and the sequence was perfect. I'd never get sick of listening over and over to this album. But three seconds into ""It's only love"" on the remix and I'm sick to death.I bought the vinyl album from Ebay. It's wonderful. I was thinking that it's so common for good artists to go commercial and destroy the beauty of their art for the sake of a buck. But in the case of ZZTOP they even went back and ruined the really good stuff they made before they went commercial.

"A quality product: Wix makes an excellent quality oil filter. Unlike many competitive and better known brands you won't find cardboard spacers and tubes or inferior paper filter media in a Wix. The silicone anti-drainback valve prevents oil from draining from the filter while your engine is off so you won't have dry starts which can be very harmful for your engine. If you hear noisy valves or knocking when you first start your car, you're probably getting dry starts. Check out the Wix website to see what goes into their filters and you'll be a Wix customer too.No, I'm not a Wix employee. However I did at one time work for an oil distributorship and learned first-hand about oil and filters through demonstrations, cut-a-ways, etc. Just because a company spends more on advertising and has a better known name doesn't mean they have a better product.

"Good Anime but Bad Boxset: Product review:I would not recommend buying this if you already own their normal dvdset or the complete series. This is not worth spending money just for the sake of collection. The Front and Back of the collectible box has advertisement of some other anime. Funimation's DTB box release was way better. Though I gave it a 2 STAR, the Anime itself gets a 5 STAR.Anime Review:Animation/BGM:Pretty decent. Opening/Ending songs are quite catchy.Story (No SPOILERS):The story is centered around a 22 year old male, who is suffering from extreme Social anxiety disorder (SAD). The story explores the human psyche and how it is affected by our daily life. Issues such as social hypocrisy, conspiracy theory, social expectation are also highlighted in this anime.

"More Great Sophie Kinsella!: I liked this book a lot, though not quite as much as the Shopaholic books, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I liked the premise for the book; it was interesting and fun reading. I recently read that Kate Hudson is going to star in the movie version of this book... congratulations to Ms. Kinsella! The only other thing I'll mention here is that there seems to be a pattern in all of her books that the heroine ends up with an extremely wealthy man, out of pure luck. A nice thought, but how often does that translate into reality? That aside, I still love all her books and am anxiously awaiting Shopaholic and Sister - hurry September!!

It is a book of poems for and about children, illustrated by photos of her children, nieces, and nephews.

"Great Muppet Movie, Does Have Widescreen: This is a great Muppet film. One of the best, although I still place Muppet Movie above it. Happy to see it released on DVD! Like other Muppet films, it has a great cast of human stars, like the amazing Tim Curry and Billy Connolly, accompanying the Muppets. Good musicals and scores sung. Muppet style humor throughout it, and as a Gonzo fan he is kind of the main star and I love that! Also want to respond to an older review and clarify that the current prints on this movie do include both Full Screen and Widescreen. I have the disc playing as I write this, so I can verify it true.

"Not quite the record it should've been.: This was Tina's first album for a major label. It's a text book case of what can go wrong when a new act is signed, a big budget is applied and there is hardly a decent song in sight. New material was in short supply, so two songs from her first indie album reappears here. Tina's strength up to the present moment has always been in the capacity of singer and performer; very old school with tons of audience interaction and sweat. See her in a small out of the way venue if you can. She has as of this year been released from her contract with Sire Records and the future of the band looks uncertain. I believe that her best work as a recording artist is yet to come if she can write or find the right songs to record. She's a rock & roll singer in need of rock & roll songs. She's one of a kind and I wish her all the best for the future.

"Western Sci Fi With a Handsome Bruce Campbell: As a Bruce Campbell fan from way back, this is an absolute must have set of DVD's. The character of Brisco County Jr. shows Bruce Campbell as a youthful and handsome fellow.

"Goldberg misses the boat: According to Bernard Goldberg his McCarthy type list is full of people who bash America. America is a land of many ideas and opinions and because the people on his list do not agree with Goldberg ,on issues, he villifies them by putting them on his hate list. He is simply bashing America and Americans who dont agree with him. The exact thing he accuses the people on his hit list of being guilty of.His writing style is an adolescent and socially immature style . The book seems much longer than it really is.

"zomg.: I'm with Peter on this one - the instrumentals for Cells were great, used in both Transporter 2 and Sin City. But the singing. Oh lord, kill me now, this has got to be some of the worst vocal stylings ever.And the lyrics are absolutely horrendous. The frontman sings about wanting to play video games (""I've got another level that I want to clear""), cooking (""we should be more adventurous with our meals""), eating (""we eat chinese off our knees""), and so forth. And that's only in the first VERSE of Cells. How the hell did such groovy music get such a horrible singer/writer? It's unbelievable. These guys are Britan's answer to garbage US bands like Hellogoodbye and Bowling For Soup.I don't really know how this band ever got a record contract... oh wait, guess the music industry is the same all over the world, nothing but trash.Apologies to anyone that thinks this music is actually good, but hey, you're wrong.

"The Millionairess-less is better !: ""The Milionairess"" is a stage play that did not translate well onto the silver screen. The filming was done many years ago and the acting is ""over-the-top"" to the point of haming-it-up. The story line is good, but presented in a somewhat hysterical and at times almost frenzied style. As a stage play it would have been good, but as a film, I do not recommend unless you are interested in the history of theatre and acting. I do not think G.B. Shaw would have been pleased with this production. The typical British humour seems lost in the frenzy of the acting.

"promising but disappointing: this camera seems great when you read about it. but when you get it, you realize it's not user friendly. We bought ours for our daughter who's 6. there only are 2 buttons on the entire camera, one of which is the shutter button. So the other button has to serve as flash, self-timer, on/off, etc. and it is not intuitive to know how to activate which feature.Most important, the software to install the driver for loading pictures onto my PC is not ""Windows Logo"" certified. According to Microsoft, this means that loading the driver for this camera could destabilize my computer or enable a virus to access my computer now or in the future.Finally, the English language version of the user's manual was written by a non-native speaker and it can be hard to interpret sometimes.I don't recommend you buy this camera.

However, one of the four bowls was broken. The person who prepared this order for shipment just wrapped each bowl in one piece of bubble wrap and then tossed it in a BIG box with a big heavy hard-cover book and another plastic item. Easy to see how one was broken. Can't believe a person in shipping did this-obviously did not think about if it would get to its destination in one piece.

"One From The Road: I recently purchased this recording without any preconceived ideas....I just saw it and bought it. I thought it was quite good; the standout are ""Hotel California"", ""I Can't Tell You Why"", ""Seven Bridges"", ""Desperado"", and of course ""Life In The Fast Lane"". The whole set is quite good - for a live set. I'm not sure what all the complaints regarding the remastering are all about. A live album is going to have flaws that's why they are ""touched up"" for listener appeal; there's no such thing as a flawless concert.This set is, for me, a good introduction to the Eagles music. I found the two songs by presidential candidate Joe Walsh a pleasent surprise. Over all, this would make a good addition to anyones cd library.

This Jacob runs into a ladder and the one at the top of the ladder. After years of trying to climb the corporate ladder, he learns to give it up and let go.

This florid and eloquently-written novel closely examines the nature of sexuality, gender and changing social values over several centuries. Not a transgender book, per se, but a glorious evisceration of the social norms that comprise our gender.

"Waste Of Money: Limp Bizkit was an artist I used to respect. 3 Dollar Bill Ya'll and Significant other were two quality CDs.In the last few years, the music industry has shifted drastically to hip-hop. Even rock artists (Limp Bizkit), began to be influenced by this movement. Unfortunately, it is one with no originality and we have all heard it before. This album offers nothing more than the dozens of others that have been pushed out to be bought by the masses of teen-agers. It is especially sad because this CD seems to use the F word as much as possible just to sell CDs.Unless, you enjoy listening to uninspired, already done music then I do not suggest this album at all. In fact, I would consider it a waste of money. Try listening to Radiohead, Metallica, etc. who actually try new things.

"Nice for wearing around the house on cold days: My wife bought a couple of these first. I saw them and liked what I saw. Then I learned that she had bought a men's vest, so I was pretty sure I could have one, too! The zipper on the pockets is necessary, since the bottom of the opening is about even with the bottom of the pocket and things can fall out. I found one that fits my chest but it is loose at the waist. I will probably take a seam in a bit to correct that. The material is pleasingly soft and warm. They clean up in the washing machine.My wife's two vests are the same size, but the waistband is larger on one than the other. They were manufactured in different countries.

In the book, the author basically says since he overcame anxiety then anyone can and that's all there is to it. He doesn't address the whys or whats of having anxiety only his experiences. Most of his anxiety came from public speaking or from approaching women. So his solution is to keep making yourself do the things that make you have anxiety over and over and over again until you don't have anxiety anymore. What a useless joke! This book totally dehumanizes a person and tries to reprogram someone as an unemotional robot. I gave it 2 stars because one case example of a music teacher was amusing so I got a good laugh. Other than that everything he does in this book is to self promote what a great person he is and how wonderful he is at everything he does.

"Laugh until it hurts...: I've been a fan of Dunham for a long time - I saw him live in Orlando in 1992(?) and was fan before that. I knew what to expect, but my wife (who has belly-laughed exactly once since we were married 8 years ago) was totally taken by surprise - she laughed so-o-o hard!!! Dunham is funny, creative and his puppets are so believable you can actually suspend belief and think of them as people. Dunham's wit is great - even off the cuff things like when a member of the audience steps out on a call of nature - Dunham waits until he comes back to continue.... One of the funniest comics you'll ever see...

"Delivers as Promised: Ordered this to inspire me to walk more and that it does and more. The slight pressure on your waist is a constant reminder to take the long way around to get where you are going and to move more. Several times a day the pedometer slips out of it's case and the leash is the catch for it. I discovered that my husband wasn't using the leash and let him know that I ordered it to protect the investment in the pedometer. Sure enough in less than a full day's time, he came to me with the sweet words ""You were right dear!"" It is so worth it.

"Exciting book with a truthful side of marital unfaithfulness: I loved this book, and against a lot of people's advice I read it on a plane from Madrid to Miami...take their advice. It makes you question everything that goes on in your flight. You want to go and ask the pilot a million questions about how his life is going and such. About the book though, I sped through it, and when I was about 50 pages to the end, I couldn't believe it was almost done. The thing that I liked most about this book was it showed how unfair a marital affair is to a wife, her family, and anyone else involved. It shows the selfishness that takes place, which I haven't read it quite a long time. It was an excellently written book, and as long as someone is not entrusting their life to a pilot at the time, they should definately read it.

"Encourages participation in my little guy: This is by far the best Elmo video we've bought. Why? Because it never fails to get my 2-1/2 year old moving! He dances throughout the ""Dancing"" segment, grunts enthusiastically with the ""First Band"" cartoon and really wants us to join in, too. The repetition and familiarity of Elmo's World seems very comforting to children and allows them to take charge and anticipate what comes next. My son loves ""Mr. Nunu"" and ""ELMO!"" so much that we tolerate the grating high-pitched voice of the little red host. I like the fact that this video makes my son want to participate, rather than lulling him into a trance like some videos do (namely, Barney).

"Great for shorter cords: I have these on some of my extra cords at work. They are really easy to use and look better than wads of extra cords secured by cable ties. The product info says it holds 8' of standard cord. I guess I'm not sure what constitutes standard cord. I have about 3' of computer cable in one and it is full. Another has about 1' of ethernet cable and it is about 1/2 full. I have one with 3' of lamp cord (that goes from the lamp to the electrical outlet) in it and it is full. So, while I find them useful and will buy them again when I have a need, I'm not sure what type of cord you would use to fit 8' in there. One other thing, because they are made for stacking, there is a nodule on the bottom of each, meant to be inserted into the top of another. This means that the bottom side (not the dome side) will not lie flat. I would prefer it if they would like flat, as I have them on my desk, but I'll live with it.

"This baby product deserves more than just 5 stars!: Out of all the millions of products a baby needs, that we have purchased or received, the mini co-sleeper is by far the best and smartest decision made! The first portable crib we bought was the Laura Ashley port-a-crib...beautiful and well made but huge! (It would not fit through doorways if you wanted to move it to another room and took up tons of space in our smaller-sized bedroom.)I had a C-section and am breastfeeding so the co-sleeper has really made our lives much easier with a new baby. It fits securely against the bedside allowing our newborn to sleep with us, but with safety. Plus, there is a ton of storage space underneath and on each end of the crib. We highly recommend the co-sleeper...it is easy to set up and break down, very sturdy and safe; well worth the money!

"Keurig Brewing System coffee is weak: I had owned a Senseo single cup coffee machine and had read so much about the keurig that I decided to take the plunge and get the top of the line B70 with which you can be the individual filter cup to use your own coffee. Well, I finished up my Senseo pods 2 days ago, and put the machine to sleep momentarily. I opened my Keurig and filter. I have made two cups of coffee with my own Starbucks coffee and both were very weak. I filled the filter cup with Decaf Expresso recommended by the manager at the Starbucks store which is bold, and I like a substantial cup of coffee, so I chose the default mug size and it was watery. Then I tried the next to largest size and it was colored water. I thought the machine had a brewing choice, but obviously not. What a waste of money. I hope Keurig takes it back, as I am going back to my Senseo.

"A very good Baroque mystery.: Myers excels at providing us a view of Baroque Venice. Amato is a wonderful, realistic character, surrounded by the cast of the opera and his family. But we are also shown the dark and unpleasant side of this period and city and it's people. The story seems to start with a fairly simple mystery and lots of suspects, but soon turns into something much darker and more complex. This is a wonderful mix of music, mystery and history.

I can also change the screen writing either horizontal or vertical. The kindle comes setup with your name and account already part of the unit and the directions for use are included already loaded into the kindle. Easy to follow directions I might add and it was not long before I was ready to chose my first book. When I chose my first book in the kindle store I was amazed by the choice of 400,000+ books, WOW and the download was lighting fast! I will no longer have books to store on book shelves. I was amazed also by the weight of the kindle, it is so lite. Last, I ordered the Belkin neoprene case and that too is very nice, easy to zip and not bulky. I have wanted a kindle for a while and I am so glad I ordered it. What will technology come forward with next?

There is an incredible range of artists and their techniques to be seen and studied in this book. The bibligraphies are conicse and very informative. Not only does it wett the appetite of the young and old, but it encourages them to delve into and study the artists who interest them and opens up a new world of art hisotry, thus educating even more. A wonderful resource and text book. The reproduction of the paintings are very good and the book is a credit to the two authors.

"Superb anthology: This anthology successfully synthesizes the work of leading social scientist in the diverse and growing field of gender and immigration. This book teaches readers about how immigrants (both men and women) are impacted by immigration policy, socialization, religion, and transnationalism.

"Think of it as two slightly overpriced bi-metal hole saws.: This kit is really two bi-metal hole saws, an arbor, and some extra trash to throw out. I bought it to bore out the undersized holes on two metal-clad french doors. I hoped the flimsy plastic guide that comes with this kit would steady the hole saw. The first time I pulled the trigger on the drill, it was like that scene in the New York episode of the Simpsons where Homer uses a jackhammer to remove the boot on his car with comical results. To finish that door I ended up butting some clamps up against the guide to prevent it from moving. For the next door, I'll simply cut a hole in a piece of plywood and clamp the plywood to the door, which will make a much sturdier guide.For a set of two bi-metal hole saws with an arbor, you can get better quality (DeWalt) for less money. Do yourself a favor and go buy DeWalt hole saws in the same sizes and make a jig similar to the one just described.

"Very Funny.: David Sedaris is one of the modern writers with a skill for comedy. The stories in this collection are funny enough to give you laughs even after the first reading.""Chipped Beef"" is one of the great early stories, demonstrating the use of understatement and overstatement to make a story of childhood one that is memorable with quite a few belly laughs.""A Plague of Tics"" gives the reader a look into physical comedy on the page. The thought of the young man shaking and licking his way to school and back, every day is so hilarious that it is quite marvelous.""The Drama Bug"" demonstrates the childhood fascination with drama but also the inflation of one's own talent with something that actually resembles talent.

"3EB does it again: While Blue doesn't jump out at you like their first release, the songs are just as good. Besides the song everybodies already heard, Never Let You Go, Wounded is the strongest track on the album. If they would just give it a chance it could go to number 1. The first 7 songs on this disc are excellent until 3EB falls flat on its face on Red Summers Sun. Why is he screeching like that? Does that take talent? And they keep shooting themselves in the foot with over-produced songs they couldn't perform live (except Slow Motion) like Camoflauge and Farther. It was a nice addition to have New Girl added in the import, although its not exactley what you would call spectacular. If you just listen to the first 7 songs this is one heckuva cd. Just turn it off after that.

I am 100% sure that the director, producer and writer of this movie never visited Pakistan and neither they studied a Pakistani family very closely before making this movie. This movie is a perfect example of an Indian product having Pakistani label on it. In other words, they labelled it Pakistani but every thing in it is Indian. When ever they want to show bad side of Indian culture or some thing insulting about it, they label it as Pakistani.In simple terms, this movie is disgusting and if you really want to watch a bunch of Indians urinating all over the place and you have enough money to waste to see people urinating then you should purchase this movie.""Indian Urination Camp"" would have been a more suitable title for this movie instead of ""east is east"".

"""Casual Thinking"": Man Ray is a band with an identity crisis. They sound like they would have rocked harder and more precisely, had Grunge never existed. But, it did, so they had to ""dumb down"" their sound and make it ""rough around the edges"" so it would be more accessible to the general public. This lack of trueness to one's self is evident in many bands of the post-Nirvana '90s. Candlebox is a prime example. They would have sounded like Skid Row, were they honest and courageous and had simply done what came naturally. Unwittingly, these bands paved the way for acts that were genuinely polished, yet ""rough around the edges"" such as Our Lady Peace or Matchbox Twenty. So do we ridicule them for their lack of integrity, or thank them for inadvertently spawning a popular genre? Either way, I didn't really enjoy this record. Thanks mainly to the vocalist and his ""lyrics"". The lead guitarist has excellent tone, though, and there are some solid, inspired moments, though not enough to genuinely impress me.

"Not all classics are worth reading...: I have made a goal to read as many of the classic books of the Western World as I can. Who voted this book into the this prestigious group anyway? The book consists of 277 pages of a young man whining about the world not being fair. Through the book he continually makes choices that bring to pass the very reality he is trying to avoid. If the goal of the book is to teach us that we create our own problems in life, it is successful. It approaches this topic in a very vulgar, drawn out way.

The cast introduces the musical numbers in character (as in, ""Ladies and Gentleman, our brother Greg""). Also, Alice inexplicably wears her blue maid uniform on stage.But the fact that they're supposed to be related occasionally seems to be overlooked. Skits where the brothers are cruising the sisters, and Donny and Marie are playing boyfriend and girlfriend are two examples. However the best is when Greg ""moves out"", and he and Carol sing a lovelorn duet to each other. Remember, they're mother and son, people!

"turns off when using side ways (hard to tell cuz u r supposed to keep away from eyes) short power cord, and does it really work?: CONS:1) This thing turns off when it's tilted side ways (try it with the lights off). You might think you're disinfecting an area, but the wand might not even be on.2) The power cord is short and unplugs very easily. It's about 5 ft long. My bed and my couch is longer than 5 ft. You have to carry an extension cord with you while using it or find somewhere to plug it every 5 ft.3) How do you know this thing really works. They could just put any light bulb in there and tell you it works.PRO'S:1) IT LOOKS COOL

"IMHO Straub should stick to novels: While reading this I felt like I was reading ""flowery"" sentences that lead nowhere & were simply distractions. Although, I thought ""Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff"" was an excellent story.The rest...""Ashputtle"" was a strange twisted tale.""Isn't It Romantic?"" was dull & so predictable.""The Ghost Village"" was very good, but seemed like a rerun.""Bunny is Good Bread"" was disturbing, but very good.""Porkpie Hat"" was a good story, but it took forever to get into. While reading the 1st 1/2 I was drowning in a sea of unnecessary information, which might be okay if it was a novel.""Hunger, An Introduction"" was almost painful to read at times.Hopefully ""Houses Without Doors"" will be better...

"Big ideas from a writer who SHOULD be a big name: It always amazes me that John E. Stith --- author of such great books as REDSHIFT RENDEZVOUS, and this one, MANHATTAN TRANSFER --- isn't often mention in the same breath as Brin, Bear, Benford, Card, and other major SF writers. He's every bit their equal, as this story demonstrates. It's a sort of melding of KIDNAPPED and James Blish's CITIES IN FLIGHT (in that the whole city of Manhattan in kidnapped by aliens, and torn right off the planet into space). Actually, if it reminds me of any other book, it's probably Arthur C Clarke's RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA. That won a Hugo --- why didn't this?

"Not the original VAs, but still a nice selection of music.: I saw this show back in Dec. 2000 and I was very impressed how they turned the cartoon into a live-action show. Unfortunately, the voice actors we know and love from the anime are not here, with the exceptions of Meowth and Pikachu. There are some great new songs (never heard on TV) on this CD, most of which tie directly into the plot. I think my favorite track is #2, ""It Will All Be Mine"", sung by the Team Rocket leader, Giovanni! This is a great choice if you like Pokemon but don't think you can listen to 2BA Master one more time...I hope someday a video/DVD version of the stage show is released. But until then, just enjoy this great CD!For more information about the show, you can visit my synopsis at http://www.dazzled.com/trsrockin/script.html. ^_^

"Good for that one cup drinker: I have had my Juan Valdez coffee pod brewer for over a year. I love it. You have to make sure that the pod is inserted properly and you don't have spills or splashes. As far as using other pods I have and do. All you have to do is make sure the paper edges are tucked in so you don't break the seal, otherwise you will have coffee and splashes.

"Leaky Feeder: I find this feeder to be really messy. This is my second disk hummingbird feeder, the previous one being a Perky Pets product that I had to replace since the threads stripped on the hanger rod after so many years. I wanted a disk feeder to use with our heater during ice storms and thought Droll Yankees would be a good choice since the Perky Pet product was too large for my hummingbird population. It has not worked out. There is a rim on the bottom in the middle (for screwing onto a ground post) that causes the disk to be unstable when you are filling and placing the top on. And, be sure you don't let the nectar in the feeder slosh around unless you feel like cleaning up the trail of sugar drops left behind from the kitchen to the feeder sight and on your shoes. I have tried not filling it too full (not an issue with my previous feeder) with no effective results. If you buy this feeder, be sure and bring your wet towel with you for mopping!

It is unbelievable to me that a woman (Callie)in her twenties could act as if she doesn't have a clue what sex is and in the next breath have feelings for a man who I felt bordered on the abusive end of the totem pole. Micah came off as an arrogant jerk which only made Callie look worse for the wear.

"Forever an Inluence!: Just felt compelled to write a review considering what I'm listening today and how far I've came from Green Day and their incredible inspirational and energetic albums, Today I'm a guy that listens from Meshuggah to Radiohead to The Beach Boys. Apart from what others have said and I quote Sonic Youth when they said ""Green Day is not punk"" and I disagree, they embodied the enegery, the cathartic explosion of youthful angst filtered through simplicity yet a complexity thats highly misubderstood. I believe they WERE punk and maybe they still are, but Dookie to me meant a lot. As a musician they were highly influential to me, and is an inlfluence I'll never deny. Dookie is an amazing album!

"cord is too short!: I have had this same grinder in white for the past 10 years. I moved into a new place with stainless steel and black appliances and wanted to get the same style grinder in black or stainless to match. It arrived today and much to my dismay, the electrical plug in cord is too short! The white one I have is 40"" from base to end of plug. This new black one is only 29"", which renders it basically useless for me. I usually grind my coffee, and then pour it directly into the top of my coffee maker. The shorter cord means I would have to unplug the grinder each time, which is a real hassle. I don't see anywhere in the description a mention of the length of the cord. This is a classic example of a simple design flaw that renders the item useless. I am going to return it. Bummer, it was perfect otherwise.

"A Different Perspective: Everyone who has studied the history of Southwest Airlines is aware that Lamar Muse was a colorful and distinctive part of the growth of the company. This book presents Muse's perspective on those days, along with a narrative of Muse's aviation career before and after his time with Southwest. However, if you are expecting another enjoyable look at the unique airline, this is not the book for you. Muse has written a significantly bitter and negative recollection of his involvement with Southwest Airlines. Both sides of every story deserve to be told, and Muse does not miss any opportunity to criticize his former colleagues. Be prepared.

"Workout? Yes Yoga? Not in my opinion.: I know I am the only person, so far, who is not entranced with this DVD. I bought it because it had such a plethora of glowing reviews. I am not happy I did.What drew me to yoga, after decades of long distance swimming, was the philosophical component of the practice. Yes, I love a strong work-out, and I do one every day (Ashtanga Primary Series, Hatha Vinyasa, or Yin-Yang), but I don't want my yoga to feel like an aerobics class. If that's what you're after then buy this DVD; but, if you want something with a bit more yogic depth I would recommend Shiva Rea's Solar DVD. (It may be sold as the Solar Lunar practice. I am partial to the Solar practice and the meditations on the Lunar disc.)The other thing I was not happy with when doing this DVD was the lack of music. Again, if you like your yoga sans music this may be the DVD for you.

"Great product--one caveat: This is a good product and works really well, and amazon has a great price on it; however, be advised that the infuser is PLASTIC, so if you make flavored teas in it, the flavor lingers. My advice to people who drink more than one kind of tea is to spring for the more expensive stainless steel infuser. One other minor issue--it ought to come with a separate lid for serving in case you remove the infuser to add something to the pot (milk, for example). There's no way to have it covered when the infuser is removed.

"I Didn't Like It And It Had Nothing To Do With It Being Silly!: I watched the first movie Zapped on Cable, I think it was on HBO or Cinemax or one of those other movie channels and I really liked it and found it very amusing but one day I was watching TV and this sequel called Zapped Again came on and I thought it was terrible and very disappointing and probably one of the worst sequels I have ever seen! And no I wasn't expecting a serious movie like The Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane. Seriously I think anyone who has seen the First Zapped movie and liked it knows that it was silly and that the sequel is likely to be silly too.

I quickly snagged copy and have been going at it ever since. Once you get through the story mode, it gets even better. You can dish it out with your friends in the multiplayer with up to 4 players at once in the holloseum. The arcade mode is old school. If you like the Armored Core Series, then get this. It is actually better in my opinion and easier. I can't wait to play Custom Robo Arena on the DS!

"We Will See...: my old 1977 chev k10 truck was having serious choke problems with the old style divorced choke. it was the thermostatic type on the intake manifold. the crossover passage that runs under the carb is plugged up therefore the spring wouldn't heat up and the choke wouldn't kick down in a timely manner or sometimes it would stick open and not work at all. i saw this version of electric type and thought it was a very good idea. the install is pretty simple. i followed them to the letter. the next day it was about 0 degrees in the morning. i pumped the gas pedal about 2 times and she started right up. no more pumping like crazy to get it going. i noticed about 3-4 minutes later it was fully open and no more choke. perfect! all the other times it would either be still on or it would be stuck open. the price (60.00) seemed a little high but it will save my starter from working so hard and save gas. so far, so good.

"Dull, not helpful: I wanted to learn how to belly dance, so I bought this based on all the good reviews. However, I found them very misleading.The way Amira teaches is not interesting or engaging. I was very bored, and I've never been bored dancing before. I'm a beginner, and even I found this to be way too easy. Dancing should be fun, yet this DVD makes it incredibly dull. Amira's instructions were not clear, and she talked a little too much about irrelevant things. I like it best when instructors are concise and to the point. It was very hard to get through the entire DVD.I would not recommend this to anybody. If you are new to belly dancing, this will most likely turn you off from it. It sure did for me, though I hope to find a better DVD sometime soon.

"Enchantment!: When I first read through this book, my mind was set on the auto-pilot of mere linear sense, trying to get some meaning from the poems. Mistake! At a second reading, I let myself drift along with the embracing flow and only then did I experience the sense of Jorie's words. I thought of how I had experienced James Joyce's Finnegan's Wake, and though not comprehending the words or even able to parse them, I began to absorb images and impressions, which became unravelled into a sort of experiencing the reality within the Music of the words. Jorie's language is, indeed, another Music which one ingests much as one experiences an intoxicant dream. Her detractors say that she is an elitist with language, and full of vain puffery. But they do not understand what they're seeing. Jorie's words are a wonderous and beautiful and magical melody!

"Great program but awful support: When the software works, I think it is great. It combines the fun of playing a game with educational activities in reading and math. However, buying the CD is just the beginning, you have to really sign up for the monthly subscription for it to go to other levels. The program is poorly written and if you don't exit it properly you are completely messed up and have to uninstall and re-install the software and you child has to go over everything again. This has happened to my son 3 times and it is very frustrating. I think they just don't want to fix this as it keeps the usage/subscription going for a longer time.

"Nice construction..........inexplicable sizing.: I bought these from a closeout site (Bargain Outfitters) through Amazon.The price was right: $43.83 (including shipping)The quality was fine: 200 gram Thinsulate insulated Dunham boots, a good all-around value boot.The size was WAY OFF!!: It stated a 4E size (EEEE in other words, for wide-footed fools like myself). Only, when I tried to get these on (with skinny socks) they wouldn't budge. These felt more like a narrow fit than a EEEE.I bought these with an amazon visa reward, the balance being absorbed by the visa. Shipping these back w/ insurance would have cost almost as much as the reward. I decided to give them to a narrow footed friend instead.Moral of the story: When buying shoes online, always look for a free return policy, or at least be sure of the fit of the shoe (in a store trial, or a brand that historically fits your type). Otherwise, you'll be in for a headache.....from tight fitting boots.

Considering the fact that it was a gift from me, I ended up looking like a complete idiot. The whole thing reminds me of a child's toy, looks and feels very flimsy. The bottom line is ""You get what you paid for,"" get something more expensive.

"Pretty good: I got this gate to keep the dogs in one section of the apartment. I picked it because it was tall & you don't have to screw anything into the wall. Another reason I picked it was because it had the auto-lock but that only worked the 1st day. It locks & is very easy to open with 1 hand which I need because I have a newborn but I need to lock it myself, it doesn't lock on it's own as described.****I'm happy with this gate but if you're buying it mainly because of the auto lock feature, don't! That doesn't work.****

"TWO GONE BAD: I have had the sirius S50 model for a year and 2 months. I have had two of these antennas go bad in that time. The first lasted about one month then it just stopped working and the radio said 'acquiring signal'. I also have the window antenna for the house dock which went bad also, so now i have to listen online or not at all. I like the sirius programming but continuously replacing antennas is such a waste of money. I am looking for an alternative, cause this antenna is bound to go bad. BEWARE!

"Strictly Political Agenda and No Substance.: I bought this book as a gift for one of my best students. I previewed it, like I preview all of my gifts to promising students and found it wanting. Yes, there is no Boole. Nothing about Boethius, Casiodorus Senator, Martianus Capella, or any of the other precursors of the Seven Liberal Arts. Godel was treated like a Hatchet Man instead of the Thoughtful Mathematician who delved into Philosophy. Chomsky was HIGHLY OVERRATED, getting 3 pages of coverage when one sentence max would have sufficed.It is a Political Agenda Book with the Trappings of a Comic Book under the Pretense of being a Logic Book. It will be my companion when I go to the Toilet as I rip out the pages for better use in Sanitation.

"REMADE/REMODELED: Usually I'm an opponent of musicians' tinkering with their records twenty years after the fact, but the new version of RAW POWER is a definite improvement over the original Bowie-produced version. Even if you own the original version, you should buy the new one. The Bowie version was great, but the sound was tinny and hollow; Iggy restores the heavy bass and gives the whole package a much meatier sound. The new version packs a heavier punch than the Sex Pistols, the Dolls, the Ramones or anybody else who followed in the Stooges' footsteps. Sure, there are a few things that will take getting used to - for instance, the celeste parts in ""Penetration"" - but after several listens, these things stop sounding out of place. Save the old version for the archives, and buy the new one for when you want to rock out! (By the way, the liner notes for this new edition are also pretty great.)

"My cats do not approve: My cats go wild for the small fur mice, and I assumed it would be much the same with these foam ones. But cats are particular creatures and the cat engineering specialist that designed these did not do enough research into the likes and dislikes of kittens.

The shape is probably also not realistic enough, and although the these toys tumble well across a hardwood floor, my Misha and Kabanos have both decidedly said NO to the soft bite mice.

"If you liked ""The Stand"" by Stephen King: (I wish there were half-star ratings here. I would have given this book 3.5 instead of 4.) The book was similar to ""The Stand"" in that there were lots of subplots swimming around, but unlike King's book, these plots never really came together. I think the author tried to put too many (good) ideas into one book; it might have done better as (I hate to say this) a trilogy. The science end of it was interesting, if not as well-researched as some other authors - although I admit science is not one of my strong points, so maybe I'm way off. But, if you like books that mix science, mythology, religion, and archeology - you'll probably enjoy this book. I'd compare it favorably to some of Lincoln Child's books in terms of creativity/ideas, even though the plot doesn't hang together as well.

The punch down tool is a must-have for terminating into Leviton Quickports (as it punches down and trims the wire simultaneously).

Amazon's $40 price is good.

"Kitty Kelly Lives!: The reason Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra became a modern classic was because it presented its story through the dispassionate historian's eye.

The science of the brain has a long way to go. I would have liked more theories and expert speculation to suppliment science's unknowns. I read it cover to cover.

"The Perfect Family: Anne Renton's {her directorial debut}The Perfect Family is a solid and well made film. There are cliches and some obvious moments, but the performances of Kathleen Turner, Emily Deschanel and a very fine supporting cast rise above the cliches. Eileen Cleary, a devout catholic is nominated for an award, Catholic Woman of the Year. Her subsequent soul-searching, and efforts to make her not so perfect family perfect is the seam that holds this family drama together. I found it believable. Having grown up in the catholic church, none of it seemed over the top to me. Emily Deschanel does a fine turn as Shannon Cleary. She has several really well played scenes with Kathleen Turner. An excellent soundtrack to move the story works really well.I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to watch it again.

Interesting panoramas, the light playing on the spinifex, the wrinkled face of an Aboriginal tracker, the otherworldly red dirt, the camels silhouetted against the skyline.Robyn represented only herself and undertook the trek for reasons even she did not understand. Seeing her develop and expand her thinking during the days and weeks and months on the track makes this a fascinating book.

The visual aspect of this book seemed to jump around too much. It was often hard to find all the code examples that I was supposed to enter for the sample applications to execute them. 90% of the time the application would not run, most likely because I missed a portion of code that I was supposed to enter.

"Another great recording: It is tough to keep up with David Murray. He records so much music and so much of it is top-notch. Although he has made forays into the ""popular realm,"" such as jazzing up the Grateful Dead, he is not a compromiser, and that can be a little rough on mainstream ears. I love his wall-of-sound melodious romps. And there is a good deal of that on this disc. There is also a bit of the discordant edge that I find difficult - there is almost always one or more such cuts on all of his recordings - and I have mixed feelings about the two vocals with Cassandra Wilson. But here is yet another David Murray disc with much more power, verve, and joyous noise than 90% of the new jazz out there.

"The trip to India was a waste of money: However, that's not what I'm here to discuss. I am here to confront a song I heard on WSHE 100.3 in Orlando, and this was around Sept./Oct. 1998. I know it was from this album, and it was the ending of the song, and she sang about ""Arse"", and then does a harmonica solo. I've narrowed it down to 2 songs, and they are: ""That I Would Be Good"", and ""UR"". I use the word ""Arse"" because if I used the real word she sings this review will never be posted. Anyway the rest of this album is all over the place. It starts off with a pretty good song called ""Front Row"" which is a rather strong dance tune, but then it gel into hard rock sludge with ""Baba"", and from there it just seems to run the gauntlet. It was just alot of spitting in the wind as far as I'm concerned, and to me there has to be a better reason to visit India.

Considering her fame, she will probably make this version of the song a hit, and that is really and truly a shame. And stupid in real life or not, shouldn't glamorize airheaded-ness, not to mention her less-than Christian style. Whatever happened to those good old religious moral values your daddy the reverend taught her? It doesn't apply to just virginity alone.

""Whole Lot Of Things"" shocked me with its poor rip-off of Jane's Addiction's ""Been Caught Stealing"".I know that's it's common and popular thses days for hip-hoppers to take successful rock melodies (as opposed to samples)and incorporate them into their own work. I haven't heard an example that I've enjoyed so far, but I'm not against the practive.My own private demo tapes are way better than this junk- and take a look at that price! I couldn't give it away... On the other hand, I'm sure Mr. Rusiak is a very nice boy and if you like his music there's nothing wrong with you- except that you should try some other music. Check out ""Ritual De Lo Habitual"" from Jane's Addiction and open the door to a larger world...

"If you've never tried a Skintimate Shaving Gel, ...: If you've never tried a Skintimate Shaving Gel, then this is the one to try. I've tried other shaving creams but nothing compares to this one. First of all, the smell is YUMMY! It leaves my skin feeling and smelling fresh, like fresh peaches. The smell even lingers on my legs when I'm through. It doesn't leave my legs feeling dry like some shaving creams. It has eight skin conditioners and vitamins E and B. They've improved the can also. It's very easy to spray out -- not messy like the old can. The opening is small and all you need is a tiny amount and VOILA -- it magically becomes a heap of lavish foam. This product will awaken your senses and make you look forward (or smell forward) to shaving!!

"Gone in under ten minutes: While my dog enjoyed this chew very much, he devoured the whole thing in under ten minutes. 40 pound Australian Shepherd that I would not describe as a particularly aggressive chewer, finished the 'average' says much faster than I expected.

"THIS IS NO DIABLO: I waited and waited for the release of this game. Back last year I waited and then they pushed back the release date to this month. Finaly I got a copy of Dungeon Siege on the day it became available. With all the hype and buzz I thought that I had last found a game as good as Diablo & Diablo II. Was I ever disapointed. Have you ever played Dark Stone? Dungeon Siege is much more like that game than Diablo. But Siege does not even match up to Dark Stone. The graphics are not so hot, combat is dificult after you get three characters in your party and my bigest complaint is that the game plays so dark you can't even see the bad guys your fighting against! In a number of battles I found myself killing the mini-boss or boss and not even knowing it until after the battle was done!The one good feature is the pack mule. But a pack mule does not a good game make. In the end Dungeon Siege is nothing special...I guess I'll just have to wait for the real thing...

"This is a wonderful CD: This is a wonderful CD filled with sounds from different corners of the world. My favorite tracks are ""Within"", ""Mist"" & ""True Virtue"" though the entire CD is good.

I can't directly compare it to Deep Forest or Enigma because Digital Moodz has their own sound but if you like them you will also like Digital Moodz.

"Dialogue: There was no Quint Tarantino style dialogue, though it offers that pretense. I found it virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. The script seemed canned and by the numbers instead of creative cinema art. De Niro is one of my favorites, but even he couldn't overcome the lousy directing and crummy script. The accents of the characters were transparently fake. There was little suspense as every scene was so predictable.If this is the best (1st I've watched) Amazon has to offer its 'prime' customers, forget that as a bonus. I couldn't work up the desire to finish watching the film, so I didn't.

"Special effects and shopworn slapstick poorly mixed.: Abbott and Costello may have been one of the all time great comedy teams, but this effort does not do them justice. The whole thing seems lifeless, as they were doing it simply to meet a contractual obligation with Universal Pictures. Director Charles Lamont cannot hide the movie's low budget (shots are recycled so many times that it becomes painful to see), obviously all the money went to the transformation and monster effects. Your time would be better spent with A&C meet Frankenstein.

"A little too country for me.: I love Ryan Adams' music. I got hooked on Rock & Roll and have bought everything he's done (with the exception of his whiskeytown stuff). At first I turned my nose up to his more country albums but after a hiatus I listened to them again and enjoyed them immensley; however, this album was just too country for me. I'd like to be able to say it's just because of my dislike for country music in general but a friend of mine who does like country music and also loves Ryan's music did not care for it either. Just my opinion, don't be upset.

"keep some spares: not a bad box, at first. Oversized but I clip it on my belt out of the way so that didn't bother me. I didn't notice the weight, the line is fine, and the speed gear reel worked great at first. First problem was the loader door jammed and i had to disassemble it to load it. Then the gear stopped working. I disassembled it, cleaned everything, and gave it way more attention than it deserved, but to no avail, ground plastic gears are useless. I'm going double or nothing and buying a Tajima gear drive line and hopefully it will last. I would still rather keep a spare of one of these than rewind a reel for as long as it takes to snap a line, so gear drive for me. If I could redesign this box, I'd use a plastic box, metal gears, a release not on the reel, and a different loader door.

"Even better than Bowling for Columbine: If you are a Michael Moore fan, you simply must have this for your collection. Even if you have never heard of Michael Moore, you will enjoy this story. Moore takes you on an eventful journey as he sets out to confront Roger Smith (GM). You will laugh, cry, and become enraged. I watched the film and then watched it agin with the commentary immediately after. This is a rare occurance. My only suggestion to make the DVD better would be to add an alternate ending in which Moore ultimately gets Roger Smith alone and sticks a foot up his hiney :). Although the story takes place in the 1980s, it is truly a timeless tale.

"Active ingredient: Elm bark: I bought these little beauties whilst performing in a radio-play and I wanted to keep my mouth moist. So I took them at regular intervals during the proceedings. I would say they did the trick. I had never heard of Slippery Elm before, but some of my fellow actors had and swore by them. I was intrigued by the fact that they contained vitamin C and rose hips. I shared them with the actors in my dressing room. One actor thought so much of them that he bought an entire bottle full for himself. I would recommend them to voice actors and to anybody especially if you suspect you're not getting enough elm bark in your diet.

"This Is Not The Solution When You Spend Your Dole Money On The Pokies!!!: This is yet another album released by the highly overrated Australian band Cold Chisel. In the track ""Standing On The Outside"" it is suggested to the listener that if they are short of cash then the solution is to rob a TAB (Aussie Betting Outlet) which glorifies a life of crime.It seems that Mr. Don Walker likes writing songs about so called ""Beautiful Losers"" but I feel there is nothing ""Glorious"" about drinking Cheap Wine on a beach all day with regrets about what you did yesterday .Perhaps the success that this band enjoyed was partly due to the fact that the listeners could all relate to the losers depicted in Mr. Wanker's songs.

"An Original Movie but nothing Great. The Movie ""Carrie"" Is Better.: I saw this movie last night for the very first time and i must say that it is not anything special. It is okay, but it is not the best. The Exorcism of Emily Rose(2005) has much more feel than this Exorcist. Oh, in the end, both Preachers die but the young girl lives, and her demons leave her body due to the exorcism that is performed on her.If you want to see a really scary film; the only one i recommend which i think is very nice and highly worth it is a movie titled, ""Carrie"" with actress Sissy Spacek. That is a Classic! A beautiful story with a Tragic ending. The final parts are sad but what a movie. Even the flute music is beautiful, very touching to the soul. Carrie is a film that i would watch again and again.

"Excellent advice on cutting fat & increasing fitness in kids: This is a well organized book with lots of useful advice and good dietary recommendations. I just have two complaints: 1) There is an assumption that heavy kids are heavy because they eat junk food and don't exercise. I'm living with a heavy kid who rarely eats junk food and has always exercised a lot. This message is frustrating, to say the least. 2) The title is a problem. My daughter is already hyper-sensitive about her weight, were I to buy this book (I read it at the library), the title itself would confirm to her that I find her ""fat."" In fact, I would purchase this book, were it not for the title because it is among the best of the books covering the subject, and I've read a number of them. I appreciate the books emphasis on physical fitness. I think a person who is physically fit has a better life and feels better in every way. Parents have an obligation to promote such well being as far as I'm concerned.

It is a good quality shirt and good thick print screening and still looks good having been washed several times.

"Tom Clancy's worse book yet.: Unlike most other Tom Clancy books, this one is not well researched nor well thought out. The plot is almost regurgetated from part of his last book. He is extremely redundant throughout the book - he repeats parts of the plot so many times you cant help but skim though portions of the text. Usually Clancy is dead nut's on technical accuracy. This time however, some of the technical aspects of the book are pure fantasy - ridiculously so. Is it a good book? Well its fair as books go, but its well below par for Tom Clancy.

"Good variety of brief workouts: The thing I like most about the Caribbean Workout series is that the segments are 20-25 minutes each. I hate to exercise, but I can talk myself into 25 minutes at a time. This DVD contains 3 different workouts that are varied enough to prevent boredom and allow the viewer to choose just one or a combination. If you want to do more than one, you don't have to do two aerobics sessions; you can do a cardio (aerobics/kickboxing) and a muscle conditioning (chi ball) or strength and flexibility (Pilates). If variety isn't enough, the setting is beautiful, so, even if I am stuck in my living room, I can at least see the sandy, sun-drenched beaches of Barbados and take my mind off the yucky exercise.

"Amazing Restoration!: My first viewing of ""The Lost World"" was a highly abridged super 8mm. film, my second a VHS tape, still highly abridged, and dark!This new restoration is a amazingly impressive restoration; the images are clear and bright, the tinting, which changes appropriatly from scene to scene, adds an important visual texture.The sound tracks are equally impressive. The classic score on the alternate channel provides the original experience, but in my opinion the newly composed score is equally impressive, and adds hugely to the impression the film makes.All in all, for people who love this genre of film, Willis O'Brien in particular, or silent films in general, this restoration is more than worth the few dollars it cost!

"Most Customizable Blizzard Game Ever: I may be a bit close to the matter to be objective, since I've been an uncharacteristic Warcraft fan since I got the very first Warcraft game, 'Orcs&Humans;', but I'd say the Warcraft games have continually gotten just better and better.This game is the biggest jump in the Warcraft series, boasting a 3D rendering engine and pulling no punches with how you can customize maps on the Custom MapEdit program. One of my favorite things is creating custom scenarios to play with friends on over Battle.net.The only reason I held it down to 4 out of 5 stars is because I anticipate The World of Warcraft, a 'Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game' which should come out this November by Blizzard, looks like it will be far better even!

"good concept, bad USB connection, and cheap band: I had one for almost 3 years. I like the idea of carrying a little PDA as a wrist watch. But the first watch I got would not connect to my PC, so I exchanged for a new one. The second one worked and I could enter limited phone #, calendar, etc. However, USB connection stopped working 2 year ago, even after I put in a new battery. I can't use it as a PDA any more, only as a stop watch with more convenient alarm options (daily, weekly, Saturday, Sunday, etc.). A few weeks ago, the watch band began to break at the rubber links. I have to buy a new watch band that does not match the watch very well (I can't find a matching replacement band). I wish Timex makes more durable watch bands and more robust USB connection for this versatile watch.

This is the way the natural guys, Reeves, Ross, Park, Delinger, Grimek, Stephans, Eiferman, Tanny etc did it back in those days and they got some incredible results--drug free.The other thing I like about this training program is that it gives you the time to have a life outside the gym.I just heard of Steve Reeves passing.

"Not As Advertised, But Still Great: According to Andre the man himself, this edition is not the complete manuscript -- it's part 1 of 2. He apparently wrote way too much to fit into 1 book, so late in the writing process he decided to split it into 2 volumes.As it stands, it is an excellent introduction to the world of 3D game programming. You really can't learn 3D game programming without understanding something about 2D game programming first (well you can, but it's just much easier this way), so don't get you stockings in a knot if you think this book isn't as informative about 3D programming as advertised -- just be patient, and wait for the next volume -- this is only the intro.

"A very good album. Definitely worth the price.: 'The Party Album' is the Vengaboys first attempt at an album and I must say, they've done a pretty good job. Their songs are upbeat and catchy and will definitely have you singing and dancing. This CD is great for parties (it was a favorite at MTV Spring Break '99) but it's also a lot of fun on your own. The only reason it doesn't get a perfect five stars is that I'm not too fond of the purely dance songs such as 'Up & Down' or 'Paradise.' Personally, I like songs that you can sing along to. And not everyone will like the techno beats.Overall, this CD is a lot of fun. If anything, 'The Party Album' has shown that the Vengaboys will be around for a while and that they have a very bright future. Pick this CD up. You won't regret it.

It also contains a memorable recording of the ""Grand Galop Chromatique"", a popular show piece in Liszt's day, but forgotten about and marred with false virtuosity.

"FaceLift excercises: This book is a joke. The stick figure drawings do not at all convey how to do the exercises and the exercises themselves are absurd! (Or at least what I can figure out the excercises to be). The excercises in this little book can be compared to trying to make your eye lashes grow by batting your eyes. It's amazing that any publisher would publish a book such as this. Oh yeah, none would. Don't waste your money.

"An excellent introduction for beginners: My (now) wife and I had never formally danced before, and with our wedding coming up we wanted to do something beyond the famous ""rock and sway."" We didn't want to spend the time and money on private lessons, so this inexpensive DVD was the perfect solution.We moved the furniture out of the way and popped in the DVD. The first of several dances covered is the simple slow dance. There were several tips that we never thought of (hand positioning, how to lead, etc). We practiced with the DVD only three times, but had it down pretty well for our first dance.We didn't exactly amaze our guests with our dancing ability, but it was much better than just swaying together out there. We had good footwork and even incorporated a twirl or two. This was just what we were looking for.

"Dissapointing: It had a lot of potential, but unfortunately came up short in many ways. At 172 pages it is painfully short. Considering the plot takes sixty pages to start moving, the story does not have much substance. Early on, it is hard to get a sense of what is going on due to constant switching of plot lines. Most of the plot lines have no back story, so you are not sure who you are reading about. This makes the first half of the book difficult to follow.This book is not worth the asking price. Anyone looking for good cyberpunk would be better off getting Richard K. Morgan's ""Altered Carbon"".

"fond nostalgia of boyhood: This is a great book for youngsters. It is a classic adventure story. Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote a great tale of adventure. I read this book in junior high school and then again in high school. I recently reread it again now in my thirties. It is still a compelling read. One grows to care for Tarzan of the Apes. The movies do not do it justice. The original is the best. A lot of the subsequent Tarzan novels do not measure up to this one. It is a bona fide classic of adventure fiction. It deserves a place next to works by Rider Haggard and Zane Grey. I find myself waxing nostalgic for youth gone by and Tarzan of the Apes is right there. A fun read at any age.

"Blow-Outs Everywhere: Luvs are priced great, but it does not make-up for the fact they are horrible at stopping blow-outs. My baby wears a size 3 and she blew-out everyday this week including twice in one day and this morning. She is within the lbs according to the package (and not on the cusp), but I am switching brands. I searched online for reviews because I saw a TV commercial last evening for Luvs blow-out protection diapers. I found nothing, so far...just people with the same gripe as me. I am stuck with a giant box I recently bought; however, I might gift the remaining to my cousin...who I do not like.

"Glorious: I had the great good fortune to be a student in Boston during some of Munch's years with the BSO. He took what he inherited from Koussevitzky, maintained, and made it even better! His Beethoven 9th is absolutely my favorite recording of it. It should be avoided if you want ponderous profundity, but if you want humanity and life, this is the one you want. It is worth the price alone, but there is nothing wrong with the other pieces in the set, especially the Martinu symphony, which Munch and the BSO premiered. If you don't know Munch's work, this is a good place to start. But don't overlook the rest of his discography, especially the ground-breaking recordings of Berlioz.

"A Boring Waste in Excess: This boring ""horror"" film does not add up to all the hype the teenage reviewers have given it, it is a very boring, very common picture. Bava spends about 1 hour in the most anti-climatic story telling ever devised by man, he drags us through a silly story line and then wants us to hang along. Hey Mr. Bava, perchance you can add some actual horror or fright in this movie? The ending is stupid also because the head suddenly bites the blind person, who was a lousy character to begin with. Grade F for pointless.....

"Surprisingly good: I had seen this cd many times on the shelves but disregarded it because of the cheesy death metal image (monster-like illustration on the cover, photo of long haired, black wearing, mean looking dudes standing in a dark forest or something like that, etc).

"Great lens: I love this lens. It is fast, sharp, and has an extremely rugged build. It is definitely a large, heavy lens compared to the DA 50-200MM, for example. On the other hand, the weather sealing is evident, the focusing ring is large, and all lens motion is internal. The SDM is quiet (though not quite a silent as the DA* 16-50mm) and silky smooth.

"North Carolina's first book on trout fishing: This book, ""Twenty Years of Hunting and Fishing in the Great Smokies,"" unavailable now, new or used, would strike me as something that would sell well in hunting and fishing shops in Western North Carolina. The legendary Mark Cathey, first mountain man to use a flyrod, is here. Don't confuse this book with ""Hunting and fishing in the Great Smokies"" (1946) by Jim Gasque, just reissued, 1n 2008, in paperback. Mark Cathy is there, too, but there's little overlapping of the stories. The pair would make great companions on the shelf of any sportsman. Sam Hunnicutt was more a mountain man than a writer; the style is semi-literate. You will have to see it for yourself to believe it.Print this book and make a buck. And save me a copy.Doug Berg

"Emperor's New Clothes, I'm afraid...: I eagerly anticipated reading this book - the testimonies from Orson Scott Card and Samuel Delany were candid and unambiguous- essentially stating ""buy this book"".This book is self indulgent and anonymous in its detail- period. No explanation as to how the circumstances arose, no explanation or insight into why or how the situation developed - despite this apparently being part of the books appeal.No general understanding of the human condition is conveyed - what race or armies of the world willingly ( by its actions) allows the atrocities Arslan ( the leader of the world, remember ) committed on the school stage for example. No, this is a shallow fantasy contrived by MJ Engh, who seeks through subliminal messages and euphamisms to assert the author's own troubled and rather singularly one dimensional thinking.One start out of five and the Emperors New Clothes for me...

"A 'Don't Miss': Can't recommend this album highly enough. If you're a fan of the Hindemith style of Classical Expressionism than Hindemith's student Arnold Cooke is for you. Arnold Cooke was very much respected in his lifetime and praised on more than one occasion by fellow composer Havergal BrianHavergal Brian: Symphonies Nos. 6 & 16; Arnold Cooke: Symphony No. 3(another British composer not to be overlooked). This performance of the Symphony no 1 also includes the wonderful ballet suite from Jabez and the Devil as well as the String Concerto in D.

"With Us Or Against Us.: There is no room for compromise is Sharanksy's world view. If you do not agree with the conservative right, then you are inherently evil and worth less as a person. His hypocrisy seems to have been overlooked by the many positive reviews of this book, and flew right over GWB's head. Democracy is fundamentally about the equality of all citizens, and freedom of speech without 'ifs' 'ands' or 'buts' is the thread that holds it together. Discussion of an educated populace is what makes a democracy work, and tolerance of those who hold conflicting views is of critical importance. This all seems to have been lost on Sharansky, who still believes the earth rotates around an American/Israeli empire and that those who disagree with him are inferior in every way and do not deserve to be treated as human beings.

"BEST BOOK YOU CAN BUY TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE!: The Total Money Makeover has not only changed my entire life, but it has changed the lives of all of my friends and family. After we purchased the book, we bought it for loved ones because of the affect it had on us. It's a great prelude to the course ""Financial Peace University"", which is free (you just have to purchase the class materials for $99 and can share them with someone). Dave is a nonsense straight forward guy. The book is written at a 6th grade reading level with big font. It's easy to understand and implement - but you have to make a choice to implement what you read. Remember it can take anywhere from 30-90 days to make something a habit. You will feel convicted and it will be a good thing. Change your life, change your future and start right now.

One can easily build a record collection by simply searching all the references present in this very entertaining tome. More pictures would be welcome in future reissues, though.

"Long Lasting Heat, could spill: Provided you pre-heat this with hot water (I just use tap water that's hot) before you pour you coffee, you will have hot coffee all day...if you don't leave the flip-top latch open all day (generally a good practice since it naturally allows the heat to escape).This thermos would have received 5 stars from me if it didn't spill (though it closes all openings, it will leak out of the latch's hole if tipped sideways, which I'm guilty of doing when my hands are full).

My only concern, and it is major, is that there is no way to attenuate the sound when one is in high volume environments like street show with amplified music.

"McPherson Folly: James McPherson has misconstrued the importance of the Battle of Anietam by asserting that its importance reached across the Altantic and influenced England and France not to aid the Confederacy. Queen Victoria declared in 1861 that England would remain neutral. Confederate Ambassador, William Lowndes Yancey knew before he left on his mission that the odds were against him. Southern cotton was no longer the only source for European mills. Egypt was already in the market.McPherson has tried to ""up the stakes"" by making claims about the importance of the battle to Lincoln's and European decisions that just are not so. He is just another northern writer trying to polish the ineffectual fighting image of the yankees, at the expense of the South.

"I'm so glad I finally read it: I bought this delightful book in 1969 from Scholastic Books, in school. I carried it around in an armload of textbooks and binders for a long time, intending to but never reading it. I wish I read it way back then! I happened upon an original copy of it in a thrift store last weekend and I bought it for 79 cents. I read it and loved it.I identified with the young man Dave because he has a dysfunctional family, weird friends and a cat he dearly loves. Plus, he and his ""Pop"" are both stormy. That was me! This book cuts to the heart of relationships. I was amazed at how well the author wrote across gender, a woman writing from the perspective of a young teenage boy. I especially enjoyed the descriptions of Cat and his antics. I think the title is what first sold me on the book, when I was a kid. I've always liked cats.I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages, whether you like cats or not.

One mediocre short story does not diminish the excellence of the overall content.I love these short stories because given my work and life schedule, I can so easily pick-up, leave off and pick up again without needing to re-read the last 10 or so pages to refresh my memory from where I last left off.

And there is very little documentation.But these provisions aside, this is an excellent disc of themore pop side of AH, and some of the songs are gemstoo, like the wry ""20 Million People"" and especially ""I'm Sure of Everything but You.""

"Essential Miles Davis: Whether you are starting a jazz collection, or you have an experienced jazz ear, Kind of Blue, is kind of FANTASTIC! I would highly recommend this album to any music listeners, from country to reggae, from rock to pop, there is something for everyone on Kind of Blue. I truly enjoy this album, and would highly recomment it to anyone with a love, or an inkling to love jazz.

"Great Book: Ganapes does a great job with this book. It starts off with the bare bones and takes you all the way to a pretty advanced stage of playing. By the end of the book if you put in the work and time you will know inside and out of the blues progression as well as how to navigate the fretboard with confidence. The studies of each chapter are tasteful and are a great way to give the reader insight into typical licks and riffs. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because Ganapes does get a little vague at times, particuliarly with chords. Sometimes he leaves out theory behind certain chord substitutions and I found his sections on thirds and sixths a bit confusing. However these things come up again in his 2nd book More Blues You Can Use so this might be by design. Anyhow, this book is an amazing accomplishment in teaching blues guitar. Ganapes also has a forum online at [...] in which you can ask him questions (how awesome is that!?!). I highly reccomend the book.

"Fun and Educational!: I'm a big fan of Sudoku in any form and found that my daughter was showing interest but my puzzles were too difficult for her. I purchased this game and we play it together.

"First Cornwell Novel Will Be My Last: ""The Last Precinct"" was, unfortunately, the first Cornwell book I have read--and will most likely be the last. This rambling, plotless narrative contains a [plot] so inane and preposterous that it makes the wilder Kennedy assassination ...theories seem highly plausable. Maybe all this would have been clearer had I read the previous Scarpetta editions--but somehow I doubt it. Perhaps Cornwell has used up the Scarpetta character and should consider jettisoning her for a fresher approach and set of characters. This novel is, at best, plodding and dull, with Cornwell's substantial knowledge of forensic techniques taking priority over an engaging plot.

"In the Evolution of Shoes, these are the humans with really big heads: I too love the Jungle Mocs. I owned a pair of ""Winter Mocs"" for more years than I can remember, and finally pitched them only because the supports had finally broken down (the soles were getting a bit thin, but all seams and stitchings were completely intact - a triumph for Chinese made shoes, frankly). The Jungle Mocs are very easy to pull on, and in a hurry can be stepped into. In a store, I gave the sample shoe some good testing at the stitch points (hefty pulling and twisting), and the shoes passed. These really are incredible casual wear shoes. Rugged good looks (I have the ""gunsmoke"" suede), dry, warm, snug, and convenient. Everything you want in a dog or shoes.

"I thought this movie was quite good: Different strokes for different folks. Of the three reviews I have read all the reviewers were bad mouthing the movie in one way or another. I found the movie quite good and the acting excellent. The story of an investigative reporter being one step behind a cold blooded murderer keeps you going until the very end(and the way the killer manages to stay ahead of the authorities is really good). Unlike some movies I have seen in the past it also has an excellent ending. If you want to see a good movie, rent it before you purchase it, so you'll only be spending a small amount for the rental, and if you're disappointed you won't be out that much money. I for one plan to purchase this movie in the near future as I thought it was well worth the time that I spent watching it.

"Additional CD content terribly unnecessary: Short review: The original album content is great. Michael Jackson was such an immensely talented artist.But the additional content is terrible. I can't imagine any other credible artist of Jackson's stature adding additional content such as this (if at all). Imagine the Beatles including 6 extra crappy rap remixes of ""Sgt.

"Buffett meets Wouk and the result is a Carnival: If you like Jimmy Buffett and have read Herman Wouk's ""Don't Stop The Carnival"" then I think you'll love this CD. I know I do. As only Jimmy Buffett could do, he has taken his band members and cast them into the various characters in Mr. Wouk's novel. As the CD moves on, I can see Jimmy as Norman Paperman, Mac McAnally as Hippolyte, Tina Gullickson as Iris, and Nadirah Shakoor as Sheila. The rest of the Coral Reefers also do a wonderful job. I truly enjoyed hearing each of them sing while playing the role of their character. The CD moves along with the flow of Mr. Wouk's novel perfectly. I can't stop listening to it, but know I will soon, so that I can read Mr. Wouk's novel once again. Hopefully the musical will make it where I live someday. Thanks Jimmy, The Coral Reefers, and Mr. Wouk. This is incredible!

"Very disappointing: I've been working in the personal and professional development arena for the past 7 years and this book has been recommended to me many times. I finally decided to read it because limiting beliefs are a common theme with many of my clients.I don't get it!It's not just that the gremlin metaphor gets taken to the extreme, it's that the promised method for ""getting out of my own way"" was nowhere to be found! When I finished the book, it felt as if there were a few chapters missing.Carson goes way too far in describing how to identify your gremlins and even visualize them but doesn't go into enough depth on moving past and eliminating them.I'd recommend this book only to someone who isn't sure what is holding them back and hasn't yet identified their limiting beliefs.

"Great as a Phone extension, but not for internet&#65533;: I actually bought this ""extension"" to use with my computer and fax software. Having cable internet service and no phone jack close to my machine, this was an excellent alternative to running a ""hard line."" The connection is just fine for voice and fax - it works perfectly, (@ about 20 feet in my situation). However, I found it's not too great for internet service. My cable recently went out and I decided to use my dial up temporarily until the cable service was back on-line. Although I have a 56K modem, the fastest it would connect was 19~20K. The wireless jack certainly worked in a pinch as I was able to retrieve email, but as a primary setup, it falls a bit short of the MFG claims.

"Love the music, but not the way it was recorded.: I have always been a fan of Nelly Furtado's music and have enjoyed her previous albums. I really like ""say it right"" when I first heard it sometime ago, but thought that the radio station had a problem because the song was badly distorted on the bass and was clipping. But then I started hearing the same distortion on other copies and have found out that was the way it was ""intentionally"" recorded. Sorry, but to me that just ruined the song and left me wanting to hear the song the way it was really being performed in the studio before they botched it up in the mixing console. I am glad I found out this information before I bought the CD (which I almost did, but would have taken it back). It is sad to me that this is considered a good thing to do to this song and others. I guess this will be the only CD of her's that I will not be purchasing.

"Written by a simpleton or a fake - you choose: This so-called expose fails the test of critical thinking. Riding on a wave of ""lets help the disadvantaged fringe"", which amazingly now includes the middle class (?), the author explores multiple examples of exploitation of victimization across multiple sectors of the economy. An intelligent reader will soon learn within the first 50 pages that this is the same ""nickel and dimed"" stuff warmed over. Is there no originality? Are all corporations really the bad guys?

"Not great: Interesting storyline, great gay scenes which is the reason for the 2 stars, but the movie is very low budget and the end is not realistic. The reviews on here all 4 and 5 star must be written by the producers or their friends. I fell for it and bought the movie, fell asleep for about 10 minutes what I did watch was just ok.

"History in Full: A single correction in response to the representation of the book on this site: the excerpt from page 56 alludes to the absence of German and Italian internment camps during WW II. This is the enduring public impression, but not actual fact. People of European origin were interned. See, for example the historic record of Crystal City, Texas for a better understanding of that time period.Note: my response is to the excerpt, and not to the rest of the book, which I have not read, thus the above 1 star rating is posted only so I can gain release from this Review section...

"maybe good to leave on during a noisy party?: Not much groundbreaking material here. Fat awkward guy gets flirty eyes from a hot skinny blonde , dic*head nemesis at work, umm.... hostages taken at an urban mall? Safe humor to watch w/ your younger kids or somethin to leave on at a party where the plot line doesn't matter. A few funny lines but mostly just absurdly delerious plot developments. There is a reason this was co-produced by Adam Sandler. It is certainly that type of turn-off-your-brain type of humor. Watch it when you are totally bored or have a free coupon to use up.

"Amazing: I have gotten more compliments wearing this cologne than any other I have ever owned. I am glad that apparently not many people know about this weird looking bottle because everyone asks me what I am wearing, it's great to be unique. My favorite thing about this cologne is that I can put it on in the morning before work and it will last all night. The scent even seems to amplify if you get a little sweat going on your chest, wrists or wherever you wear your scent.Amazing stuff, every woman would like their man to wear this scent. Just be glad that you found it and most other men haven't! Your lady will thank you for it.

"No support for Windows XP!: Well I've been searching for Chess games recently and I'm surprised that this version which is being released in September 2002 is not compatible with Windows XP!Yes look at the requirements: Windows 95 / 98 / Meor go to UBI Soft's website and indeed they are not supporting Windows XP for most of their games including this one. They say something about Windows XP having a new file type that is not compatible with their software.GRRRR I mean come on!

"Good book: As an American living in the UK, I found that this book gave a good insight into the small differences that make the US and the UK so similar but so different.

"Bad customer service and Cheap Printers: We have had our printer for a little for over a year (also a bit over warranty, of course). We have had a paper feeding issue, so I spent two hours on a phone with someone from India trying to correct the problem. They eventually sent me a new one.

"Little Brother Grows Up: This is a nice, uncomplicated film about a boy whose older sister is kidnapped by Indians of a type never seen in the area. Because it is largely his fault that she was taken, he decides to go after the sister, hunting for the unknown Indians as he goes. Along the way, he meets the usual Western characters and finally ends up ""racing the sun"" across a valley to help his sister. I've watched this a bunch of times and always enjoy it. It's about in the same genre as ""Across the Great Divide"" and ""Seven Alone""(which also stars Stewart Peterson, if memory serves) as well as ""Where The Red Fern Grows"" and makes a good family movie to watch. Perhaps some of it is a stretch to believe, but it's enjoyable and you really don't mind.

It messes things up in a hurry :)Anyway, the (good) one at work has a dull finish and is made in China. The new (faulty) one has a shiny finish and is made in Mexico. I even returned the new one and got one at a local store, with the same results. It is also a shiny finish and made in Mexico.

"Not very impressed: The monitor mount had a joint that is meant for tilting the screen forwards or backwards. This joint is very loose and wobbly, even though it's tightened all the way, and causes the screen to tilt left and right and be crooked.When the whole arm is extended, the screen rests tilted to one direction so its obviously not level, and when the arm is retracted the screen rests tilted to the other direction and also obviously not level. This also makes it so you can't adjust the screws holding it to the wall to fix the tilt either way.

"Interesting topic, questionable characterizations: This book deals with one of the great mysteries in history - who killed Philip II, father of Alexander the Great. My biggest complaint with this novel is the author's note. The author states that Alexander's character is very much as found in the historical documents; ""rather shy, self-effacing, suffering from panic attacks, and very shy of women."" Not quite. Every ancient source portrays him as gregarious, prone to excessive ego and ambition, incredibly bold and often reckless. There is no indication he was shy around women, rather that he was somewhat disinterested in them sexually until his mid-20's. Alexander had conquered the known world by his 30th birthday, and one has to question the author's opinion of his character.For those who wish to make up their minds for themselves about Alexander's character, I recommend A.B. Bosworth's excellent, ""Conquest and Empire, the Reign of Alexander the Great,"" available, of course, from Amazon.com.

"Too hard for a kid!: I purchased this book for my five year old son, knowing I would have to help him somewhat in assembling the ships. I soon realized that this was no easy job - for a kid or an adult! My husband made one ship, and I made another, and we both were very frustrated at the difficulty level. The instructions were very brief and unclear, and pictures were not included on two of the ships - so we had a hard time deciding what they were supposed to look like! I would not recommend this book for anyone under 10 years of age, and maybe older. Granted, the color printing was nice, and one ship did turn out pretty neat. But overall, this would be best for teenagers or older Star Wars fans.

"Delightful, Readable, and Surprisingly Real: ... There is no snobbishness; just a comedy of manners, so to speak, that is delightful, readable, and surprisingly real. Perhaps the reviewer didn't know what to make of a prostitution novel that lacked the usual elements of such stories; abuse, violence, degradation, exposure, etc. Nancy is fully aware of the worst elements of her profession, as are Jasmine and Allison, each in their own way. Yet she manages to create for herself a life that steers reasonably clear of these dangers and approaches her chosen profession, sex, with the same professionalism you see in other fields. Those who haven't had direct contact with this world may find it hard to believe Nancy's approach to prostitution can be real, or for whatever reasons, they may prefer to deny that it can be real. But the book is real (subject perhaps, to literary license that's no greater than that taken by any other novelist). Tracy Quan knows. So do I.

The packing looks nice because of the colorful pictures and art work but the material used is cheap. I wish Ashutosh Govariker had chosen company like Yashraj Films to release the DVD. The Film is divided on 2 DVDs. When you load the 2nd DVD for the 2nd half of the film you have to go through UTV's stupid senseless startup routine!

Weak attempts at funk don't manage to measure up to the excitement of Xzibit's character. Lyrically, he's pretty decent, but not great. The hooks are too wordy for what he's attempting. He's been saying this album is 120% better than his last album- he's dreaming. E-Swift, Thayod, Sir Jinx and DJ Muggs brought real heat to those previous albums. Dr. Dre and company don't really do anything for this album that is senses shattering. It's an attempt to include Xzibit to the ""L.A."" sound, but that sound is played. It's time for new music, something exciting. This ain't it. ""Only in the money for the fame Xtra large, that's Paparazzi.""

This 2-CD set has the recorded evidence of the validity of these accusations on every track. Thus, it is a valueable document for teachers and players to show how someone famous, who could play all the notes and had a stellar career, could be a bad interpreter and performer.His ""feeling"" for Romantic repertoire was so eccentric that he makes some of the pieces sound like early jazz or ragtime. To hear it is to believe, and, if you believe in the myth of I.P as a great artist, prepare to have your bubble burst.

The space suits had a regular zipper in the back - to make sure the vacuum and poison gases don't get them !! The helmets that they used for their Mars space walks simply plopped down on the suit with no seal of any kind.At one point Gallo suddenly proclaims that they only have 12 hours of air left, and asks one of the women for sex so that they can enjoy their waning hours.I can't believe this movie is actually sitting on a shelf for rental.

The examples are right on par, though, for teaching you examples. If you have no other programming experience, you'll probably want to avoid this book, as I felt it was good only if you knew Javascript already and wanted to perform a neat trick or two with the stuff. Most of it involves graphical quirks rather than form processing and such.There are better books around, but this one has its place. If the examples were cross browser compatible, I'd give this book a higher rating.

"Love, love, looooooved it!: This book is remarkable. I got this book after I found myself interested in becoming a midwife and I couldn't have found a more perfect book to help solidify my decision. I never wanted to put it down, though at times I was forced to. There were many nights I stayed up until 2 in the morning just because I wanted to finish reading about the births. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in childbirth. It is filled with laughter, joy, sadness, and a great deal of happiness. This is an amazing book and I wish Peggy Vincent's stories didn't end.

"Love them: These monster feet are great, my daughter is three and at first was intimidated by them. But then my husband and I began playing with them and she joined it. We let her watch How to Train your Dragon and told her they were dragon feet because she is scared of monsters. She also loves the Gruffalo,so when we read it she pretends that they are his feet and walks around reinacting the story. So she was able to pretend that the coloring of purple was the purple prickles on the gruffalo. Great toy, perfect for imaginative play, and physical exercise.

"Moog is the standard of excellence: These anti-roll bar end links replaced the stamped steel and plastic ones on our 2002 Focus. The stock ones were completely separated on one side (the ball had popped out of the plastic socket), so the body roll was not being controlled by the anti-roll bar at all. The stock Ford parts are underbuilt and breakage-prone weak points. The Moog parts are, by contrast, very heavily overbuilt, have grease fittings and a strong metal-on-metal design that can't (by design) fail in the way Fords do. The ability to be greased (if used, of course) keeps the wear, and subsequent noise, factor to a minimum. Also, the Moog end links have wrench flats at the stud base to simplify torqueing the nuts properly. The flats do need a thin-jawed wrench (a regular open end or combination wrench, not a Crescent wrench), but are an otherwise fine feature.

"""Is something burning?"": This is an extremely well done screen adaptation of a unique play. You expect nothing less from the team of Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. However they do not distract from the performances of the other actors who are well-known in their own right. Harry Ellerbe, who plays Smithers, played the main role of Richard Sumner in the play.Bunny and her staff and the research department are all preparing for Christmas season. But who should appear on a seen but the mysterious Richard Sumner, with a tape measure, 24 questions, and mysterious past in electronic brains. The conversation between Richard Sumner and Bunny are worth with film its self; yet it only gets better from there.Like many plays the real worth and interest is in the dialog and interaction of the characters more than the action or the overall story. You will get wrapped up in the fun and wince once in a while.Bad Day at Black Rock ~ Spencer Tracy

It was definitely as I expected- no miracle or anything, but after reading the review that says to make sure it's right-side-up, helped me out so much. I was aware of the possible mix-up so I made sure I was wearing it like the picture displays (no pic comes with product, just looking at the one online).

"Ah. Um. Mmm.: Broken Prey is just filler in an a series that's usually more engaging than this. Lucas Davenport goes bossing everyone around and doing whatever he wants in the course of his investigation into some brutal murders in Minnesota. The writing is barely passable, and the dialogue is sophomoric and punctuated with gems like ""Ah"" ""Um"" and Hmmm"".There's no clever detective work, and Lucas grunts and swears for 380 pages until the killer's name finally turns up. It seems as though we learn in the first 30 pages or so that a nutter has to be stopped--but we blunder along for 300 pages basically learning nothing until Sandford decides to let Lucas find the key to the killer's identity.Folks, this is pretty junky stuff. I heartily recommend something (almost anything) else off your book list.

"Permanently jammed after 3 rivets: I'll be returning this next time I go near their store (ACE Hardware). The first three rivets snapped into place satisfactorily (but not easily). On the 4th rivet, it jammed. The tool would neither release the partially installed rivet nor continue to complete the setting. I had to McGuyver it off and finish the project with nuts & bolts. I was using rivets from the same manufacturer in the correct size for the head installed. There was no ""ratcheting"" action to make setting easier - probably due to the tool's incapability to release its grip.

RF shielding is also good. I have near by numerous RF transmitting devices of varying frequencies and power levels, and see no changes or drops in video quality during transmission.The HDMI video cable fits on to the HDMI port on the adaptor with ease. The DVI side of the adaptor uses the standard connector screws to secure the cable to the DVI port on the monitor.For the price, and assuming consistent manufacturing quality, I recommend this video cable adaptor.Item was promptly shipped by Eforcity.

"A Quick Read: This is a very informative book that can be read in a about one to two hours. It isn't as in-depth as I thought it would be but it certainly provides some updated and interesting information on Six Sigma. My advice for people who may buy this book is to purchase this book along with 'Leading Six Sigma', 'Lean Six Sigma', and if you are new to Six Sigma, 'Sailing Through Six Sigma with CD' for an overall appreciation of Six Sigma. This is not a book that discusses the DMAIC model or the actual statisitics involved in Six Sigma in any great length so if that is what you're looking for you need to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for some of the most up to date information on Six Sigma this book is well worth the price.

"Well written, but unfortunately way out of date: It's amazing how much the JavaScript world has changed.This book has a relaxing style, and it was enjoyable to read. However, it no longer represents what I think of as ""modern"" JavaScript. For instance, it doesn't cover closures until appendix B, and even then it tells the reader to avoid them. These days, having studied Dojo, jQuery, and Douglas Crockford's videos, it's clear that closures are at the heart of how modern JavaScript is written.The copyright for this book is 2006, yet the index doesn't even mention Firebug, YUI, dojo, or jQuery which are now staples of the JavaScript community. Although, dojo is at least mentioned in the list of Ajax frameworks and libraries.This book is an interesting piece of the history of JavaScript, but for those wanting to learn modern JavaScript, I recommend watching Douglas Crockford's videos instead.

"¡Fantástica! ¡Verdaderamente Impresionante!: A.J.Quinnell sabe cómo hacer fluir la adrenalina a quien lee éste libro. Me resulta interesante la forma como hace que la personalidad del taciturno Creasy se vuelva tierna y temible a la vez. Tal vez todos tengamos a un Creasy dentro de nosotros, que tiene muchas cosas, menos el verdadero cariño de alguien muy especial, como le resultaron a él su amigo Guido y la muy vivaz y tierna Pinta. Las relaciones entre Creasy y la niña me hacen sentir que mis hijos para mí son lo más importante del mundo, que merecen nuestra total atención y cuidado, porque todos, alguna vez, también fuimos niños. Y quisismos mucho a ese alguien especial como Pinta a Creasy. Lástima que Quinnell la mata, fué lo más triste de la historia, y no lo niego: lloré a Pinta. En verdad la recomiendo. Me siento muy identificado con el sentir del personaje principal. aunque no me considero tan violento.

Honestly, I think I would have preferred hearing from ""real"" DL guys who really wanted to protect their anonymity by hiding behind a screen. I think they would have felt comfortable telling what it's really like to be on the DL, without fearing any repercussion. Also, though this movie depict men of African decent, I hope the viewers understand being on the DL has no racial boundaries...all races and cultures are included in this phenomena.

"Too disturbing for most readers: Written in a claustrophobic, stream-of-consciousness style, this is a portrait of a young woman deeply damaged by emotional and physical incest. The broken chronology and distorted perceptions make the reader feel as confused as the protagonist herself. I had to force myself to finish reading the book. It might have been worthwhile if there were some character development and resolution of the protagonist's psychological problems. Instead I was disappointed by an apparent happy ending that seemed forced and unbelievable. Marble Skin may be well-written (apart from the contrived ending), but it's certainly not enjoyable reading.

"A Good Read: Another incredible book by Dan Brown, and in some ways a prequel (cliché term of the decade) to The Da Vinci Code. This book is actually the introduction to Robert Langdon, the main hero of The Da Vinci Code. It gives you another shining example of his Vatican, cult, and symbollogy knowledge wrapped up in a very compelling adventure story of deceit, faith, attraction, protocol, and of course, Catholic history. Definitely a great story, but don't be fooled: You do not have to read it to understand any part of The Da Vinci Code.There are rare parts that could have moved a bit faster, but they do not greatly impact the anxiety and excitement of the book.

"Item Received Not as Advertised: The item advetised is the 976LM/977LM Garage Door Wireless Keyless Entry Pad. It was a good price, s0 I ordered two. Surprise! I received 2 940CBs instead. The Liftmaster website recommended at 977LM for my garage door. When contacted, the seller stated it is an older model and that 977 was listed on the package. I looked and, you guessed it,it didn't. The package said 940CB only and a typed label added to the package mentioned 976, not 977. The advertised model is white. These are grey. While the 940CB does work with our door, it is obvious on our white garage door frame. I might have purchased an older model at this price, but would have appreciatd the opportunity to price-compare it and make the decision myself. To avoid any further waste of time, I have decided to keep the units, but would not do business with this seller again.

"A great addition to the Clancy techno-thriller collection!: Classic Clancy! Continuing the Clancy tradition of intenational intrigue, Clancy puts Jack Ryan in the world's most powerful, yet vulnerable position. Tom Clancy is a master of knitting together international politics, military insight, technological savvy, and thrilling spy drama. Before reading this novel, I would recommend reading all the other ""Jack Ryan"" novels from Clancy. ""Executive Orders"" draws from these other works frequently and the reader won't want to miss any of the exciting elements that are alluded to here.Bring on some more, Tom!

"Childishly Written: I am a right wing super freak. I have no problems with the facts or views in this book. I do have a problem with the ""emotional coloring"" by Sammon. It's like he's trying activate certain emotions and attitudes that are childishly simplistic. Right out of the gate we go into the siege of Rove's home by misinformed libby protestors. Rove comes off sounding like a man cowering in a corner while people pound on his windows like a dawn of the dead movie.

"Last time I get ""good"" blades: Going by the reviews I figured these blades had to be the best on the market. Next time I'll just get some decent ones from Walmart or something... The first time I used them I noticed one pin-line along the wipe. I figured it picked up some dirt or something so I washed off my windshield then cleaned the blades with a damp cloth. Next time it rained, I saw another streak or two. Benefit of the doubt, I cleaned it all up once more. Today, I saw a good 10 lines alone where it wiped. Realize the car sits in a garage and any dirt is from the road. I am thoroughly disappointed in these. I don't feel I'm expecting too much, just something that leaves the glass clear!

I am not giving it 5 stars because he is my brother - in fact, he wrote another book, ""Sex is Not a Four Letter Word"", that I would only rate 4 stars (a little to 'professorial' for my taste, Charles). I have used a lot of journals from organizations such as FranklinCovey, Maxwell Leadership and the Leadership Challenge and this one ranks right there in the mix.It is a perfect mixture of thoughtful insights and writing space. Unlike many journals, there is an opening section that helps set the stage for the journaling adventure which explans how to have success from the inside out - at the core.If you've used other journals and are ready to go to another level, this one's for you.

You'd love it too. Then-12 Emma Watson, 14 year old Dan Radcliffe, and 15 year old Rupert Grint star in this and are great actors. They truly make this movie worthwhile!

"More Lucas magic: Set years after the movie ""Willow,"" Shadow Moon chronicles the adventures of a darker version of the deminutive magician, now calling himself Thorn Drumheller, on his way to the ascention of Elora Danan, a female child who he saved in the movie and is destined for greatness. But she has become more of a spoilt brat than the saviour of the world, and before he can set her right, discovers the Deciever, a sinister entity which has taken form, and calls itself Willow. Grimer setting than the movie, but correct for the story being told and the atmosphere is perfectly presented by movie maker Lucas and comic author Claremont.

I urge you to by this edition which includes critical essays on CANE. Not that they can ever truly dissect it -- that's what makes it so great.

"Poltergeist - a traversty: I become thoroughly disillusioned when misty swirls emanated from the TV. This film doesn't just have cheesy effects, it comes across as a parody of what it should have been. The family seemed pretty unconcerned about the unnatural occurrences. If chairs start moving by themselves across a room surely anyone would rush out and try and get professional help. At times I thought this could be a Disney production for kiddies. The acting was pretty lack-lustre. The strongest reactions I had to this film were disbelief that the producers could try to present such silly effects and also I had to laugh at the ineptitude of the acting. Thing is best categorised as a feeble comedy

I think it is amazing and does a great job. I followed all the instuctions, and also wrapped my feet in plastic wrap (what they do at the salon) for the few minutes it was on. It worked great even the first time. One foot was on a little longer than 5 minutes because I was working on the other one. It didn't bother me at all, did not seem to effect the non callused skin at all. Love this stuff!!!

"Ann Coulter Makes Her Case . . .: Coulter makes a strong case that liberals have long given up legitimate debate in favor of name-calling and demonization. At the same time, her return fire is so hot she makes a case for herself as the most gifted polemicist of the last decade. Not even William F. Buckley at his most withering generated the kind of heat Coulter does. It's clear that this book is the glove that slaps a face with every intention of starting a fight. As a conservative frustrated by being constantly compared to Nazi's and racists for opposing things like high taxes, I found myself hoping someone would accept her challenge.The only possible criticism of the book is that Ann stoops the level of her opponents on several occasions by calling them dumb. In fairness to her, she provides the evidence for her charge more often than not!

This movie is about a boxer trying to make it to the top of his sport. He struggles through poverty, betrayal and spite. He pulls through to gain victory. Jimmy Smits is the younger version of Edward James Olmos. Highly insightful into the life of the Chicano macho male. Gives the viewer a balanced understanding of the Mexican American culture.

"Very Well Done!: I had heard about Sherlock from some friends of mine, and I was immediately skeptical. I love the canon stories; always have since I got them from our library as a young teenager. But my friends told me they thought I'd actually like it, so I got online to watch the trailer. That intrigued me! I saw enough of the Sherlock Holmes references to reassure me that the writers probably also had a deep respect for the original work, yet a modern-day version was a fantastic idea--if it could be pulled off well. And it was! I saw the first two episodes back-to-back last night from Netflix and I'm completely ready to watch more! I just hope this series continues for a very long time--at least long enough to adapt all the best of the canon stories into today's world! :) As long as the show remains as excellent as the first season, I have no complaints. Very well done, gentlemen!!

"Biography that reads as a well-written novel: This book begins with a murder - the mother (Aurora) killing her 17-year-old daughter (Hildegart). Hildegart was a political, feminist child-genius in Spain. Her major activity occurred between 1928-1933. She was a planned superwoman of her mother who raised her specifically to fulfill a political mission. The author has done an excellent job of portraying the socialist movement of the period and the roots of Aurora's project. There is the usual gap between words and deeds, the political deals, the self-serving compromises etc. But most of all there is a mother on a mission, ignoring and overriding anything for Hildegart that is outside Aurora's goal.Beautifully written, this book is very appropriate to our times. It shows in a sympathic way the dangers of fanaticism.

Erak sounds ten times better on their previous two albums, even though his voice isnt that astounding. It really seems as if he is trying to BE a singer without pulling it off.These three guys still rock at playing powerful, intricate pieces of music though and it shows, especially on tracks ten and twelve. It's just too bad they had to turn down their unique screams, crys and yelps for third rate crooning.Tracks six and eleven should have been erased from history.

"Boring.: Me and a friend saw this movie back in 1988 and were bored. There have been other movies for this period that were better so it was not so much of the plot as it was just how it all flowed. The guy with the restaurant was laughable with his ""get out"" scenes when the one son accepted his being gay and the the other son no longer condemned his brother for it. Additionally, the restaurant just was not happening but that only added to what should have been the humorous part of the film but I guess I forgot to laugh being bored from the rest of it.

"Seemed like good value, but machine broke after 2 months: The 12-cup machine is what you need. Don't buy the 4-cup machine because that's barely enough coffee for large mug. I know because I had to ship the 4-cup machine back and re-order this 12-cup one. So the coffee was OK (not great, but not terrible) but then the machine suddenly stopped working. I can't turn it on. I tried returning it, but because I didn't buy it from Amazon directly (but through a vendor) that was not an option after the initial 3-4 week returns window. I'll call Amazon again though... a machine shouldn't last only 2 months.Lessons learned:1) Buy from Amazon directly so you can return items if you need to. Otherwise hard to return to small vendors. Amazon is so much easier to deal with.2) You really do get what you pay for. I'm sure others had this machine work for years and it was fine, but I didn't get so lucky. Keep this in mind. I don't think it's a high quality brand.Hope this helps!

"not worth the price of a rental: I rented the DVD with a girlfriend last week and boy was I sorry, as nothing happens and it goes on forever. Almost everyone looks at least 15 years too old for their characters and Sam Neill (usually respectable) sleepwalks thru his part along with everyone else.I'm a Christian myself, but the story's ""Hallmark Channel Christian conversion agenda"" was unnecessary and very transparent. There are also a few racial stereotype jokes in bad taste, the special FX are below average, and the sets look like all the other ""magical miniseries"" sets. Weirdest of all was the way they chose to present Merlin as a weak uninteresting man who can't do much but evidently has great PR. Even King Arthur was a whiny weak drip.The one plus is that the music score is surprisingly nice on the ears, but that still doesn't make Merlin worth a rental.

"A Review of Tangerine for Teachers.: I enjoyed reading this book with my class. The students enjoyed talking about Paul and how he handled some tense situations. The author portrayed Paul as a person who wanted to have a normal school life, normal friends. He wanted a family who was open and honest with each other.

"Perfect for limited space: This is perfect for getting your hair dryer and curling iron off of a bathroom counter with limited space. It's sturdy and also holds a couple of hair products. I wound the cords around the shelf that holds the curling iron so it saved a lot of space and hassle with cords. Highly recommend!

"My new daily companion: I did some internet research on pedometers and found this one to have the most favorable reviews. I saw it listed @ Wal-Mart, but when I went to my local store it was no where to be found...LAME. So I drove back home and ordered it thru Amazon.com . It arrived when they said it would, it was packaged well and I've been oh-so-happy with my new addition. I use it daily and mark my steps on my calendar...I like that I can go up to a week without losing my data. The buttons are easy to navigate and the display is easy to read. Set-up was easy to do without too much trouble.

"Nice radios for traveling: I recently got these radios for Christmas and I am pretty impressed. They are easy to use with very clear sound. I previously had a set of Motorola 2 mile radios and in comparison, the T7100Rs work 100x better. I just got back from a vacation in Disney World and found these radios to be extremely handy. In the group of people we were traveling with we had my two 7-miles, and 4 2-miles. No matter where you were in the park you could always hear who had the 7-mile radios which wasn't always the case with the 2-miles. The only draw back was that they were just a little bit bitter than the normal Motorola radios. If you are buying these radios expecting to use them over any 7 mile terrain, don't. When they test the distance, they do so in some flat part of the dessert. I think these radios are great and would recomend them to any casual user wanting a little extra range.

"poorly crafted and easily broken: I've gone through two of these tripods because i desperately wanted it to be as good as i'd imagined. Unfortunately the product is poorly built and both of mine came apart easily when trying to wrap it around something. The joints crack easily and i discovered pre-existing cracks in both of mine. I don't know a better product to recommend, and i'd love it if this one worked as i imagined, but unfortunately it just wasn't worth the hassle.

"One of Paul McCartney's best albums: For me, Flaming Pie ranks among Paul McCartney's best albums. Overall, the songs are enjoyable to listen to, and the album includes relaxing sounds (such as Heaven on a Sunday, Souvenir, and Little Willow) to a more upbeat, rocking sound (such as The World Tonight, If You Wanna, Used To Be Bad, and the others).This album is a good mix of songs, showing McCartney's diverse style and writing abilities, and is good to listen to on a relaxing Sunday afternoon or any time. It's definately one of McCartney's best.

"Not at their best: Not much to add to the other reviews except to agree that it is by no means their best album. Not wishing to offend anyone, it seems to me that their sound is becoming more american - I suppose your environment influences you as a writer/composer and as the band have made the USA their home it was bound to happen. I just feel like that they've lost an edge that Chrome and Happy Days had, but I've still got them to listen too and as as with many of their albums I guess it'll grow on me as I didn't like Chrome to begin with - and eventually I had to replace the vinyl as I'd worn it out so there you go. Still a fan.

"Outstanding addition to a home theater: As a home theater enthusiast, I'm regularly tweaking my surround sound system for the best experience. Bass management can be a chore, getting the overlap between the subwoofer and the other speaker as natural as possible, yet still get the thumping bass experience. I decided to try the buttkicker, and it was the best ""tweak"" I've done to my system in a long time. Other have talked about the installation and benefits. So, I'll just mention that one reason I love the buttkicer is that I can still get that big bass movie experience without the high sound pressure levels you need from just a sub. So, you can watch a movie at a very reasonable volume but feel likes it much louder. If you like concert DVD's - the buttkicker really adds a life-like feel to the bass drum. A very cool, great product.

"""His music has been overlooked for too long!"": RCA Victor presents Keith Jarrett's music, very much like the American standards to which he has devoted his jazz performing in the last two decades, is hummable, witty, rhythmically infectious and structurally solid. Few artists define greatness as powerfully as Jarrett does, his profound influence on modern music is celebrated by a wide range of groundbreaking artists who explore and re-interpret his strikingly original music. Jarrett has reached such fame by mastering the different genres of jazz and classical music, and his uncategorizable improvisations, is nothing short of astounding.This entire CD is simply awesome, with today's artists giving their all to this musical tribute - ""The Music of Keith Jarrett"", one of the best jazz albums to come out with original music that has been overlooked for too long!Total Time: 58:52 on 13 Tracks/ RCA Victor - 09026 63607 2 (2000)

"Worst. Movie. Ever.: Like the other reviewers have said, my daughter is a huge fan of Finding Nemo and Turtles: Sammy's Adventures. Anything to do with the water, she loves. So I saw this movie for $10 and bought it thinking we'd add it to our fish collection.It takes a long time before any ""plot"" gets going, scene transitions are non-existent (just jumps from one thing to another), characters are unlikable and mean to one another, violence and words that I wouldn't expect in a movie that has ""Family Friendly"" stamped on the front, and it was just overall boring and dumb. And then when the ending credits started rolling, I saw ""made by Al Jazeera Children's network"". WHAT?!?!This movie is going in the trash.

"Nice watch- while it lasted: I owned this model for about six years. I found the watch easy to use, and functional. It was my first titanium watch, and I found the strap held up fine relative to scratches. The reason I give this watch one star, is that it leaked. I recently noted condensation under the glass. I sent it back to Citizen and they indicated the case tube leaked. Now out of warranty, I can change the CASE and MOVEMENT to repair. So- basically I need a whole new watch.So, while I enjoyed the watch I am disappointed that it failed in this manner.I have bought several Eco-Drives for friends and family as gifts, but will no longer buy Citizen products.

"different, but don't just push it away: Many kids who are in the scene have a distinct disliking of what Victory does to bands (CBK comes to mind), but the latest release of With Honor should be an exception to this rule. Yes, most people consider their old EPs and Heart Means Everything to be classics in the modern hardcore scene but they shouldn't frown on This Is Our Revenge. Whereas the band does take on a far more melodic rhythm than on their previous albums, and making similarities between them and the numerous melodic hardcore acts of the mid-90s (Good Riddance, Kid Dynamite, think Jade Tree) wouldn't be wrong, I don't feel that they have completely lost their edge. With Honor are merely just showing what else they can do and are trying to change things up in a scene that is becoming very large but quite stagnant at the moment.

"As a Democrat and an American, I am disgusted: Nicholson Baker has lost a fan forever. I loved his earlier works, but this is a repugnant piece of propaganda.I am a democrat (I did volunteer work for both Wesley Clark and Howard Dean's campaign)and even I am disgusted by this. Even if you hate the President, he is still the President and more importantly, a living human being with a family. To have a character explore ways to kill him (even in fiction) crosses the line. I read this in Barnes and Noble, and am so glad I didn't buy it.Note to Mr. Baker- How do you think The President's children would feel reading this book? Live up to your moral responsibilities as an artist!

"Music Cleansing the Doors of Perception: William Blake himself would love this album, I've no doubt. It takes atmospheric, ambient music with electronic effects and varied instrumentation and imaginatively combines this with Blake's Songs of Innocence & Experience, Marriage of Heaven & Hell, and Auguries of Innocence in a creative and compelling fusion. The feel of Blake's imaginative, prophetic vision is evoked with great insight, sometimes in utterly unexpected musical idioms that I would've thought implausible (""Tyger Tyger"" as Reggae!) and to a degree that succeeded in giving me chills (""Holy Thursday"" especially) as few things do in these jaded days. Jah Wobble's narration of Blake's poetry, while coming just a wee bit close to over-dramatic in a few spots, captures its rhythms and emotions incredibly well, and he weaves this into the music wonderfully. The blend seems so organically appropriate, one suspects that Blake did indeed have a hand in inspiring it.

"The Facts Laid Bare: This book is the most complete ""who's who"" of the entire Soviet Communist movement from the early 1900s on. It effectively destroys the old notions that there was no connection between the Communist Party U.S.A. and Moscow. It demonstrates beyond question that Moscow's two-fold plan in the United States - influencing government policy and spying - were carried out for years by the people identified in the government hearings. The Venona decrypts, together with the examination of Soviet and American Communist archives, bring together the entire despicable story. A must-read book for those who want to sort fact from fiction concerning the history of the Soviet Union.

"Epidemic of E18 errors shortly after warranty: Avoid this camera at all costs. Mine failed only shortly out of warranty with an E18 error. Search the net for ""canon e18 error"" and you will see hundreds of similar problems. A little research seems to indicate that the MTBF (mean time between failures) is about 16-18 months on this and several other Canon models. A high percentage of cameras are failing. I see no signs that Canon has any intention of doing the right thing, all they will do is try to charge you more to repair it than the camera is worth.While it works it's a good camera and takes decent pics, but this price for a camera that becomes a useless hunk of metal at 18 months is truly unacceptable.

"Completely Without Merit: Having used other video calibration disks before (the Digital Essentials and a few others I can't recall), I have to say that this DVD isn't worth the plastic it's encoded on. There is basically no real information, and the set-up is guided by some wanna-be pop star who goes out of her way to make the whole process as non-technical as possible by removing any indication of what you're actually trying to achieve. The few calibrations they have you work through are basic at best, and they entirely skip over color calibration. Pure uselessness.

I think the handle might be a bit too thick (esp. for little hands), but it does make a good 'beginner' paddleball toy. The only thing that worries me is the elastic string. It's a bit long and not very strong, so for those who can't hit the ball, it seems like it will tear and eventually break off. This is an overall good toy!

"Not true at all: Although this book has excellent pictures in black and white and gives some good information, many of the storylines in the descriptions of the movie ARE NOT TRUE. For example, I quote, ""In response to the hypothetical question of what one should do upon finding someone's wallet, Edward suggests giving money to friends. LATER ON, Edward is caught by the police taking part in a break-in..."" Anyone who has seen this movie knows that Edward breaks into Jim's house BEFORE Mr. Boggs gives him the pep talk on right and wrong. Even the movies are presented in the wrong order. They present Batman Returns before Batman. Many other mistakes are made. If you are a huge fan of Tim Burton like I am, I suggest reading Tim Burton(Virgin Film) by Jim Smith and J Clive Matthews. That one gives much more and quite better im formation on the best director (in my opinion) EVER!!!

However, within these pages there are a few precious pieces, due in every way to King himself, not to this book or its creators. Perhaps it may serve as a good introduction to King for those who haven't had much exposure to him. Or better yet, go buy a book he really DID write.

I really wanted to turn this movie off in the middle cause I just couldn't take it but I was able to get through it (with a little fast forwarding).

And it was also hysterically funny in many parts.I was very upset when they cancelled the show, but you know, that's OK.

Even the film prints were black and white so no chance to see the series on a film projector....but now.....after all these years and several generations later here is Flipper in glorious color! I have to commend MGM for the excellent transfer probably from the original film stock. Looks like it came from 35 mm. The storylines are harmless fun...and yes we can put up with the constant repeats of all those dolphin clips. I'm sure there must have been more than a few ""flippers"" involved.

There are no special features exept scene acess.The movie itself sucked beyond any comperison. It makes Bambi look like a terrifying heart pounding movie. The horrible acting, lame effects, pathetic music,the furry little monster who looks like a hampster on steriods and oh god the horrible cliche storyline as well as every cheap monster cliche trick possible.Such as the creatures hand grabs hold of acorner and it's head slowly apears around the wall or it leaps at the camra just to suck every last thrill into the movie. That is possible the scariest part of the movie. And finnaly if you want a comedy or an example of a bad horrer film here it is.

"disappointed: I bought this disc on amazon.com due to the recommondation of the site. I was very disappointed as this had nothing whatever to do with any bluegrass or instrumental guitar work that I was familiar with. This sounds like someone looking for a style somewhere between ""new country"" or what passes for country nowdays amd the junk that passes for pop.

"Answers to the often elusive question: Knowing God's will is often a topic of extreme confusion. How do we know what God wants for our life? This book explain the issues clearly and gives the truth from Scripture regarding how we may know absolutely what God wants us to do. An excellent read.

"Delivers excellent sound without outside interference: One of the greatest features of these headphones is the way they seal your ears from the endless droll of computer fans, noisy children, and occasionally dear mother.The sound is clear, and true to form -- just as it was intended to be heard. Other headphones of inferior quality might be capable of ""more bass,"" but the EH2270's bass is punchy and far from muddled. A great asset for the all-around music listener.The $200 price tag seems a bit high, since I paid around $70. If you can find them for under $100, then consider it a great value because few headphones sport the same quality to price ratio.Perfect headphones if the price is right and you appreciate neutrality in your music.

"B& D thermal coffee maker: This is a dreadful product, originally supplied by 6AVE and sold by Amazon and now only sold by 6AVE. The thermal carafe began leaking and we originally thought is was just dribbling when pouring. Then it began pouring--out of the bottom seam and also the bottom. Obviously, the glass insert was cracked. When contacting the seller directly they were not helpful re returning the product but Amazon stepped in and reimbursed through their A to Z guarantee service. You guys at Amazon really know how to keep customers! Thanks.Buyer beware.

"Holy digital technology!: This is a reissue of the 1966 soundtrack for the original Batman television show. It doesn't feature the hit single version of the ""Batman Theme"" by Neal Hefti. The version here is by Nelson Riddle. All the music here, other than the ""Batman Theme"", is credited to Nelson Riddle. But in fact, ""Batusi A-Go! Go!"" and ""To the Batmobile"" are rewrites of the ""Batman Theme"". Plus, ""Two Perfectly Ordinary People"" is a ripoff of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"", and ""Batman Thaws Mr. Freeze"" is based on a classical melody that I can't remember the title of. The music here isn't all that great, although I must admit that ""Holy Flypaper"" is a pretty good sax and guitar instrumental. The CD also features a lot of the campy dialogue from the show. The biggest ripoff about this album is that it's only 24 minutes long. This is for hardcore Batman collectors only.

The music is electric, fast paced, and exciting. The plot is funny and charming. The cinamatography and the nostalgia factor is also good. The movie is hands down perfect. Danny and Sandy are icons in the movie world. They are the ultimate teen couple. The film is definately one of the greatest films of the nineteen seventies. This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again. See it at least once.

"Pretty weak shtick: If Matisyahu were a black guy, this would be a mediocre pop reggae album circa 1988, and you probably wouldn't even consider buying it. But he is a hasid and capitalizes on this shtick, and somehow we are supposed to think this makes the music sound better. Sure the word ""zion"" is peppered throughout his lyrics, and there's some psuedo spiritual angle here that offers some redemption, but overall it's pretty weak. His fake jamaican accent, overly produced electronic sound remind me of some bad reggae from way back!

"Okay, but nothing new, nothing great.: Byler's debut is indeed impressive, as the hype indicates. However, contrary to critical consensus, Byler's voice is not all that new; in fact, I found it to be rather tired and trite, though often amusing. All in all, though, this book--oh, another thing: no way is this a novel--is better than much of the [stuff] that's published these days, but there's not one ounce of originality in any of the stories. Even the structure is borrowed: from Hemingway, no less. Byler, get real, get fresh, do something new with your newfound fame. Don't believe your own hype.

"Yikes.: The author strikes me as a kind of Morpheus-want-to-be telling the reader why they came to this book, or why the book came to them. They also seem to be hung up on the yr. 2000 presidential election where our established system rightfully put our president in the presidential seat by the electoral vote--not the popular vote. I have just as equal of a voice as this author and I say I agree with the Bible that it is God who raises up national leaders to accomplish His purposes.Conversations with God for Teens is a good look into the delusional mind of an author that wishes God would give answers like these. There is some truth in the book, but it serves to make it easier to swallow the lies that are mixed with it--lies and truth go down like arsenic and sugar.

"Didn't feel like a real candle: My husband bought these for me when he could not find a similar product by Philips that we'd seen in the Netherlands this summer. Unfortunately the Viatek candles aren't nearly as nice. The Viatek candles give a light that is too yellow and flickers too much. They just don't feel like real candles. They're also a pain to turn on and off. You have to remove the ""candle"" from the glass holder and push the button on the bottom. To turn the Philips candles on and off, you simply turn the candle and holder upside down for a moment. Skip Viatek and hold out for something better.

"guide for healthy living and knowledgeable health care: A good summary of health care for women. The text includes descriptions of conditions which women should be aware of (e.g., breast cancer, depression) as well as treatment options. In addition the text includes sections on women's mental health and on environmental sources of health problems (job, stress, cleaning solutions). One very nice feature of _The New Our Bodies, Ourselves_ is that each chapter ends with a listing of resources. If, in reading a chapter, you find something on which you would like more information, several sources will be listed at the end of the chapter. I have used this text in my ""Psychology of Gender"" course and the female students have all reacted _very_ positively to the book. This is high praise considering the students are quite conservative in their thinking

I was in my twenties at the time and could not get enough of the amazing stuff that kept coming out. I listened to the radio all the time, and found a couple of stations that played only the kind of songs which you didn't hear on the top forty radio stations, all of which are on this soundtrack. ""Nowhere Girl"" was one of my favorites at the time and I was thrilled to hear it for the first time in about thirteen years. I do, however, like the original version of ""Sooner or Later"" by General Public better than Harvey Danger's. But, it's a small price to pay for the coolest movie soundtrack I've ever heard.

The controls are programmed so that, unless you follow the sequence dictated by the designer, some controls will not work. For example, you must press the All Off in order to be able to turn the TV back on after it was activated. So, if a command was not received by the TV (because of an obstruction, or your spouse used another controller), your 880 plays dead.It is the worst remote that I ever purchased, and I have a large number of them.

"For fans of Miss Kelly: Personally I like Kelly Osbourne alot which is probably one of the reasons I like this album. It's not bad, ""One Word"" is phenomonal and there's a few others that can strike a chord with women who've had some trouble with men (who hasn't) and those who may have had an addiction or two. I have the two previous albums and honestly really like this one much better. The other two were very manufactured and I think even Kelly knew that but when given a shot why the hell not. If you're a fan of Kelly, if you love it when those new wave 80's songs come on the radio then this is all you, if not.....I wouldn't suggest it.

"Excellent Watch: All I needed was something that was cheap, not fragile, and would tell me the time. This fit the bill. Mine was $9.35 and was well worth it. I bought it a couple months ago and it is all I could ask for. The band is a flexible resin (which is essentially thin rubber), the casing over the face and hands of the watch is plastic so I don't have to be concerned about breaking it on anything, the knob to set the time is easy to maneuver, and it was less than ten dollars. This is a watch that does what it is supposed to, doesn't seem like it will break, and even if it does it can be easily replaced. Recommended.

It's brim full of appreciating friendship and close relationships far over presents, and even innately crabby Rabbit is easily moved to a sweet and tender heart... Very amusing when they all exchanged personas... Love this and highly recommend it for little ones... The special features offered on this DVD are awesome, too...

I installed this in my garage in order to control three fluorescent ceiling fixtures (the long rod type, not CFLs).

The flickering is the most annoying part. In ""ON"" the lights are fine. In AUTO they flicker or blink every so often. I'm returning this ASAP.

Clifton Webb was excellent as the father. In the sequel Belles On Their toes Clifton Webb is an angel who looks down on his family when they are having all of their problems. Cheaper By The Dozen also stars 2 of the greatest actoresses ever Myrna Loy, and Jeanne Crain. For years these 2 films have been out of print and hard to find.

"Evolution Should Not Be Presented As Factual: Evolution - a religion for those who don't want to believe in a sovereign God. That's right folks, evolution is a theory. There is no evidence in the fossil record of whales evolving from land based animals. Dig deeper. The whole theory of evolution is falling apart these days. And it's outrageous that some are trying to teach our children that this stuff is indeed fact, when it is not. We need to be telling our kids that they are special - that they were created by a God who loves them, wants the best for them, and has a purpose for their lives. But no. These people would tell your kids that they came from apes. From goo to you, by way of the zoo. Garbage. For you real thinkers out there, ask yourself the honest question: Where did the universe come from? Logical analysis concludes that only an eternal God could have brought it into being.

"Second rate at best: This is a People magazine type approach to the biographical history of some of the key players in modern western esotericim. Unfortunately, the author never rises above the level of gossip informed by a palpable contempt for his subjects.Sadly, the author isn't even a good writer. He has as his subjects the most eccentric and quirky individuals imaginable. Yet the book is really quite dull. It takes considerable commitment to trudge through the 400 pages of text.Besides a lack of sympathy for his subjects, it is also clear that the author's knowledge of theosophy, anthroposophy, the work of Gurdjieff and his progeny is entirely superficial. The author's intepretations and insights range from banal cliches to ill informed whoppers.No one who actually knows anything about this subject will find this book to be satisfactory. Those who don't know much will gain little from this book except some background information.

"The truth is still available for those who endevour to find it.: Franken skillfully unties the Gordian knots within the Bush administration's many political deceptions one lie at a time from Al Qaida, Chilabi and the economy to Wolfowitz, war and Zarqawi. While his witty humor adds just the right amount of levity to an otherwise disheartening series of truisms - I was struck by the amount of research, detail and clarity he brings to each discussion. This is a well researched book that is on par with serious political authors like Howard Zinn, Noam Chompski, Arundhati Roy, Mark Crispin Miller and Jimmy Carter. In addition, Franken's familiarity with mainstream media and the many players within it provide an unusual glimpse into how the media spin game is played. I recommend this book (I purchased the audio CD which was especially good) to anyone wanting to understand the political landscape and interests of our time - albeit with some humor thrown in.

"Would definitely recommend!: This was my first drink-mixing book that I bought and I am happy I did! I love the layout of the book! You can search recipes by what alcohol you have laying around or you can search by type of drink. I love that it tells you the history of the liquors, terms, what glasses to use for what etc. It really is handy for a first-time drink maker! The only thing I wish it would have are drink illustrations/pictures, but that's just my taste! Thank you!

"AWESOME, MYSTICAL AND CAPTIVATING!: This is one of my favourite books of all time. The characters are rich, deep, and possess an off-beat mystical sense of wonder. Follow the trail of frenetic characters, Sal and Dean, as they set out on a wild ride across America. For those who are freedom lovers and remember the nostalgic days of the Beat movement, you will love the escapades and adventures encountered in this book. It is a journey into a search for self-insight and life's true purpose and meaning. Based on the Beat movement of the 50's, the reader will be exposed to the mystical wonder and beauty of life, compassion for humanity, and encounter a world of drugs, sex and jazz. The characters are so vibrant, the actions so real, you will feel as if you are actually there, along side these dynamic characters. Do not miss this book; it is a terrific adventure in an era when freedom meant ""doing your own thing, in your own way, in your own time.""

"Something for Everyone: My favorite college professor recommended this book as a birthday present for my father. Both love the Bard, and are proud of their endless knowledge of him. This book managed to provide new, interesting information, even for them. I picked it up along the way, and was enthralled. It is very well written and easy to read. This is the perfect Bard book, for PhDs and enthusiasts as well as the average reader.

"""Hello,"" said the creature.: I was delighted to rediscover this book when cleaning out my parents' house. It had gotten lost, somehow, in moving from childhood to adulthood and I had honestly nearly forgotten about it.Almost, but not quite. Henderson is a wonderful writer whose short stories bring to mind the best prose of Clifford D. Simak or Theodore Sturgeon. In the end, I discovered that I had not forgotten a word. The worlds of Zenna Henderson are not necessarily happy worlds. There is sweetness, and there is often resolution of a kind. But the sweetness is often bittersweet, and the resolution is not always exactly what a reader might hope or expect.Recommended for any reader who likes intelligent speculative fiction. Should be suitable for all ages. If you can find it, buy it!

"Beware February 17, 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I purchased this radio back in March 2007. Clearly, it is 100% terrific. However, apparently I am going to have to toss it in the trash on February 17, 2009 when digital television hits the airwaves. A total pity!Incidentally, in March 2007, this radio cost me $15.44 plus shipping. I guess the increased cost is to cover its new ""antique"" status.

"Jane Eyre with a twist: This was a very engaging story. Written in the style of a Gothic novel, this story is very reminiscent of Jane Eyre, with a unique twist. The secret to the story is revealed to the reader as the main character figures it out, in a very realistic way.What prevented this book from getting 5 stars was what I felt to be an unnecessary subplot that only served to bog the story down. I understand that our main character needed a ""hook"" of some kind to be convinced to write the biography she's been charged with writing, but I felt that Setterfield took the ""ghost story"" aspect of her lost twin too far.That would not stop me from heartily recommending this book to anyone who likes Gothic novels.

"railroad reading: One of those books that is referenced by just about every author that writes about the railroad industry - not just the collapse of the regulated railroad industry, but any story of business turmoil. You could simply change the names of the players, the names of the companies, and the industries, and this book applies to unmanageable size and warring factions on the top floor. This is considered the ""gold standard"" of the Penn Central collapse, and a cornerstone book to any railroad historian.

"Don't Buy: We were looking to replace an old iron and liked the features listed on the box. Auto shut-off, the ready indicator, self-clean feature, and the steaming options. What they don't put on the box is how annoying the beeping ready indicator and the warning beep that the iron is about to shut off, the three beeps indicating that the iron has shut off, and the annoying clicking sound it makes when it is plugged in but is shut off. These in addition to the leaking feature make this iron very hard to have and make ironing more of an annoying chore.

"Definitly a disappointment: I just recently became a Vivien Leigh fan after seeing her in great films. I picked this up at my public library, looking foward to see her again. When I put into my VCR and when this movie appeared at the screen, I must say I was terribly disappointed. Nothing like GWTW or Waterloo Bridge. Her version of Cleopatra was ofial. And Claude Rains also gave me a bad impression, since it was the first time I had ever seen him on screen. I fell asleep half way through the movie, and when I woke up, I intended to fall back asleep. It was a horrible waste to my Saturday evening. But you can't be totally harsh because Vivien Leigh was going through some tough times during the making of the movie. But i'd recommended Waterloo Bridge, or GWTW, or any other Vivien Leigh film, but not CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA.

Thanks for nothing, Paul, thanks a lot...OK, and for those getting on my case about not reading the listing online: I saw it in a store (remember those?), grabbed it, bought it, played it, not even thinking the record company had screwed around with it. Lesson learned: caveat emptor.And give us Yanks the US version, Paul! A 10 song album is now 9 songs? Come on, son...

"Best used as a kitchen ornament and nothing else: Basically all the negative reviews about this product are true. I would recommend this juicer to anyone who is looking to build upper-body strength while making juice, because the hinges really don't work well after a while (and I've tried lubricating them), so you'll end up exerting all you can just to squeeze an orange. But watch out because the small suction cups aren't enough to prevent it from flipping over when you're putting all that force on the off-center handle.This product was badly designed and is seriously not worth its price tag.

"No subtitles: I liked this film but would have enjoyed it much better if it had english subtitles. It is clearly a propaganda film that shows Mao as a happy man who cares for everybody, nearly the exact opposite of real life. It has some interesting scenes of Chinese daily life. Credits include a few italian film makers, so maybe the Chinese had some help putting this together. In some ways it was interesting to see a staged color film of Mao (an actor) rather than grainy black and white images. A lot of extras were used to show the fanaticism around Mao.

"trite rich kid junk: this book didn't deserve to be published. perhaps it had something to do with the fact that the 18-year-old author's godfather is president of Grove Atlantic, the house that published the book, and his parents are famous authors and magazine editors--you think?the writing is pathetic--every single chapter starts with a character's name. this is freshman writing 101. the author has no idea what he's writing about, either; the book is rife with implausibilities (an utterly unconvincing drug trip; a kid who buys machine guns from a corner store; a pampered white kid sent to a NYC jail and finding out that it's 'not so bad'--HA!).The characters are poor, too--it's impossible to tell them apart, to tell who's who. Important character info is lazily withheld until late in the book (the protagonist is a bird enthusiast? what?), when the author was running out of things to say and needed to take up some pages. don't waste your money on this garbage.

"Fatal Flaw: Regardless of using Windows Media Player or simply dragging and dropping files, it did NOT want to play the files in alphabetical order. It always looked for track numbers (if available). Even if you sorted the files first in WMP.If you use WMP and keep everything in playlists, you'll be OK. But if you have various podcasts and songs you want to arrange in your own order of play, forget it. Your chosen order of play will be lost when you sync the songs. Same is true if you rename the files (a, b, c before the file names) in the order you want and then drag and drop.

"Sunlight's Colors: In ""The Other Side"", Chuck Brown and Eva Cassidy team up for an earthy and colorful set of jazz, blues and soul.

Unafraid to explore different musical styles, she created a real beauty that can only come from real talent, heartbreak and hope. In this and her other albums, Eva Cassidy's voice breaks music into a range of styles like a rainbow breaks sunlight into its colors.

"A Girl With Grit and Soul: I saw Ms. Lightman's video of 'Devils and Angels' on MTV and loved it. I'm 43 and this music is right up my alley. I love tracks 2 and 8 the best, but I would describe the entire albumn as a bit of Bonnie Raitt/Shakira with a bit of Sade thrown in. It definitely has jazz and soul overtones throughout. The more I listen, the more I like it. Especially after playing track 2 (Devils & Angels) about 10 times first. It's nice to have a fresh new gritty female voice to listen to after my Nickelback CD. She plays that acoustic guitar very well. It sings its own song. This reminds me of my 3 Doors Down CD in that I loved the first 6 songs on the first CD, but I actually liked their second CD even better. I think Ms. Lightman is sure to turn out many more songs with grit and soul...I'm looking forward to it.

"Great Little Piece of Classic Television: My late mother was a big fan of Loretta Young. I had never seen the series until last year on Sky Angel Satellite. I wanted to see what it was that intrigued my mom. In the process, my wife became a big fan of The Loretta Young Show and asked for this set for her birthday. We both enjoyed watching the complete first season and look forward to more collections. What I am sure my mother liked about this show (& Loretta Young, in general) was her faith and moral values. It's too bad television today has gone so far over to the dark side that one could never imagine seeing a program like this produced today! The extras are nice, but we found the biography a little disappointing. It ends with her starting the TV series! Nice price and definitely worth every dollar.

"Short, succinct, and thought-provoking.: I have always viewed fans of military history with suspicion, having known too many who are weapon-fetishists, power-worshippers or simply ghouls. Fortunately for me, a sane, gentle friend read and recommended this book (thanks Mike Malcolm, where ever you are), introducing me to a now favorite author. MASK analyzes and contrasts the military leadership of four men: Alexander, Wellington, Grant and Hitler. Each profile is fascinating in itself, but what impressed me profoundly was the final chapter, in which Keegan brings everything together, enumerating the ""imperatives"" of military authority throughout history, and finally asking how those imperatives can be met in the nuclear world, where the civilian population is on the front lines and generals must necessarily ""lead"" from behind. I recommend this book (and all Keegan's work) wholeheartedly to anyone who would never dream of reading ""military history"".

I grew up with Astro boy and I'm glad that they're trying to bring it back. They stayed true to the original drawing design and yet gave it a fresh modern look and a good story line as far as I'm concerned. Seeing it in color for the first time was great.

"We shall be the haunted men...: I first bought this a few days before I went to a Damned gig in Islington and brought it back to shop the next day (I traded it for Rage Against The Machine's ""Evil Empire""). At that point, the only albums I knew were ""Machine Gun Etiquette"" and ""Damned, Damned, Damned"" which are very silly, punk albums but as soon as I put ""Phantasmagoria"" in my CD player I got really confused... No distortion, No speed and most of all... No Sensible.But then I discovered the links between ""MGE"" and ""Phantasmagoria"". That is ""The Black Album"" and ""Strawberries"" and eventually it prepared me for ""Phantasmagoria"". So any fans of the punk albums, listen to ""The Black Album"" and then ""Strawberries"" before you try this one out. This pretty much like ""Distintegration"" by the Cure (which I highly recomend in addition of this Damned opus if you are into this kind of stuff).P.S.: Oh yeah... This edition should have included ""Eloise"" and ""Temptation"" rather than those bloody remixes.

"Great coffee maker, poor lifespan: I purchased this coffee maker about 18 months ago based on all of the good reviews. I was happy with the coffee maker, it has a self cleaning option and it looks good too. It does not seem to make the coffee scalding hot if that is how you like it. The worst thing about it is it just died on me after 18 months. The heater element seems to have burned out, the coffee maker light comes on but it does not process the water. I smelled an electrical burning smell when it stopped working. Hopefully I just had a bad unit and this is not indicative of the product.

"Its ok: It served its purpose until I could buy a real 360 controller to use on my laptop to play some pc games(indigo prophecy,jade empire,halo 2, and etc). It was really good on certain games like pyschonauts.

"Swindled by the Swivel Sweeper: What a piece of junk. I purchased this through BB&B for use on my new hardwood floors and it worked great the first 3 times or so I used it. Then the battery would start dying after 5-10 minutes of use despite the fact that it had been charging for days. I no longer had the receipt/box to return the item. I emailed Ontel directly and never heard from them. Please save your money and buy something that will work for many many years to come rather than days.

"This headlamp rocks: Headlamps have totally replaced flashlights, and this headlamp is terrific. It's bright, long-lasting, and comfortable to wear because it's so light. I even prefer it to my itty-bitty reading light for reading at night.

"Description has been updated, but still misleading: When I ordered this product, the description did not contain ""J-K Color"" or the tables describing different sizes and clarity ratings. I was relying on the picture and the regular price of $220, which made $45 seem like a bargain.I returned this product after it arrived. These things are microscopic and extremely cloudy. There is no way you could magnify them to any extent, under any lighting, where they would look like the picture in the description. If you saw these for $220 in a retail store, you would be in Chile.

"Disappointing: It's a clever concept and yes his prose is a bit florid, but generally entertaining. Yet, the execution leaves much to be desired. There just isn't much in here which is new or groundbreaking. Also, I've been a professional ancient historian for many years and I have never seen a classicist with more venom towards Hector's character.

"Sooooo disappointed!!: Thank God I didn't pay the inflated prices on Ebay! I bought the entire set (Clubhouse, animated figures and the counting car) for my son for Christmas because he has just fallen in love with Mickey lately! I was very disappointed with all of it! The slide and the foot part would not stay attached, the figures hardly worked (they had to be pushed down on really hard to do anything) and it didn't play the song! The only upside to all of this is that when I took the whole thing back and got back over $90 I was able to get some great after Christmas deals on some other toys for my son so all's well that ends well!

"Murder at a Monastery: I've seen only the film and did not read the book. But I object to attempts by other reviewers here to make more of the story than the tragic fact that a successful monastic community was wiped out by a bunch of sadistic murderers. Forget the politics. This is a story of pure barbarism. Religious monks are slaughtered by human animals, many of whom are now paying the price for their crimes in Hell.

"If only life was so black and white.: The whole premise of the book is that everyone has the same definition of honesty, financial stability, spirituality ect. If you acknowledge different people have different interpratations of these things the book falls fat on its face.

"product defect and not worth returning for the price: The flag arrived on time but has either some kind of ink or stain in the orange area. It's not worth the trouble to go to the post office and return for 3.99. I can't find how to contact the seller and ask for another one and the dial back from Amazon customer service (call back now option) didn't work twice.I would rather have paid more and gotten a good product.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006HDI5Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title

"20 minutes of movie trailers!: what's the deal with te half hour of studio promos at the beginning of this DVD? You can't even go into the menu and skip through it, you have to either agonize through it or fast forward!...I sincerely hope Disney does not create a trend by doing this.

"An excellent, if heavily technical, layman's guide: This book is an excellent introduction to the history of the English language. As the other reviewers have noted, it's a bit top-heavy on technical linguistics, and therefore may not be suitable to everyone. But if you don't mind reading a book which could also be used as a 400-level college textbook... I think this book would appeal to any who have an interest in linguistics in general and the history on English in particular - especially if you've read other, lighter books on the topic already and you're ready to get seriously into the topic.I fit the above category, and I loved this book. Probably the best I've read on the subject so far.

"Buy this CD...: ...if you want to listen to truly drab, uninspired and talentless material. this has about as much to do with country music as a cab driver from new york city. it just proves the old axiom that most people are a sucker for a pretty face. the songs on here are true bubblegum pop, so if you're 13 and want to tell your boyfriend bobby how much you love him, then go ahead and buy him a copy. otherwise, spend your money on something more worthwhile, like 750 two-cent stamps. this music is an insult to the roots and traditions of country music, and just proves that the corporate record companies are more interested in quantity than quality. we can only hope that her marriage falls apart so she's forced into some real introspection that may or may not inspire some thoughtful material.--Raul Duke

"Great spirtual film from ""Facing the Giants"" creator: For those who enjoyed ""Facing the Giants,"" this is an earlier production made by the same Georgia church on a shoestring budget -- but still well done. This is the moving (and sometimes funny) story of a cheating, morally bankrupt car dealer who is behind on his bills. A spiritual experience leads him to re-evaluate his dealings in surprisingly different ways. Like ""Giants,"" this film is better than you would expect considering the budget and is proof you don't need millions to entertain or move people. Film was run at Georgia area movie theater and shocked the church with the attendance, which prompted longer and wider play in the theater's chain. Obviously, success of ""Giants"" appears to be prompting a national release of this film by Sony, but that's a good move. I was looking for an older DVD, but I'll wait for the new release.

"A&E Bios are are Sensational. *: A&E; Biography gets worse as it goes along. Sensationalist*, unattributed claptrap.I feel deceived and it wasn't even fun. They even edited classic works of art to serve their purpose.(*See, I fooled you.) Flotsam. The colors are pretty and the music is nice.

"Not really HD, don't buy this yet.: Just to inform those on the fence about this release, it is not true HD. If it was, it would be 1920x1080p resolution, which is 16:9. This is 4:3 however, so Funimation is scamming the public. If you own the original season sets, stick with those and play them on your 360/PS3/Blu-Ray player in order to upscale to HD. They look just as good and are 16:9. These new sets are rip-offs.

"Fun Game, Cheap Components: Farkle is a very fun game to play. The problem with this unit is how cheap the contents in the box are. The dice cup is small and plastic, not the typical leather bound dice cup most of us are used to. The dice are also very low end. My suggestion would be to go out to a bar game store and buy a good dice cup, good dice, and then download the rules for this game off of the internet.It was only $10.00, but it just wasn't worth it.

"worst book you'll ever see: I did not read the whole book. I only read a few pages at Barnes and Noble. The critics are only half right. There are plenty of suggestions in this book. The problem is, they are incredibly stupid. Don't use deodorant. Avoid bad news from TV and newspapers. Shower in purified water. I'd rather have diabetes, asthma, and high cholestrol than do the time and money consuming things on this list. I'm fat, but I dont blame Wendy's or KFC(as Mr. Trudeau does). Other than that, Mr. Trudeau goes on with mindless rambling about how greedy pharmecutical corporations are(as if we didn't know that already). Following Mr. Trudeau's advice will lead to paranoias and phobias of all sorts. Mr Trudeau and his followers belong in the same category as David Koresh and Jonestown. I'm really scared that these people have the right to vote.

"Whole album not as good as the Title Song: In case you are attracted to this album because you've heard the title song -- beware. I really like the song ""Return to Pooh Corner"" so I bought the whole album. I didn't like the rest of the album nearly as much. It's a little to ""soft rock"" for my tastes; kind of lulabye music -- but not really. Definitely not 'get-up-and-dance' music. I recommend ""A Child's Celebration of Song"" album which has many good songs by various artists including the song that initially attracted me to this alubum ""Return to Pooh Corner.""
